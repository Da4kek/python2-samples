This directory contains the standard Python2.0
documentation set.  Python's standard manuals are
available in HTML form in the PythonManuals directory;
point your web browser to (or just click on) the file
Unpacked\index.html there.  The Overview directory 
contains various 2.0 release notes.

Note that on Windows, the standard Python manuals are 
also accessible via the Programs/Python entry in your 
"Start" button; they are opened as local files in your
web browser.  The latest and greatest versions of the 
manuals are also viewable online, at www.python.org.
