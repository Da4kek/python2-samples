8.1 Structured Documentation 
</H2>

<P>
Most of the small changes to the <SPAN CLASS="logo,LaTeX">L<SUP><SMALL>A</SMALL></SUP>T<SMALL>E</SMALL>X</SPAN> markup have been made
    with an eye to divorcing the markup from the presentation, making
    both a bit more maintainable.  Over the course of 1998, a large
    number of changes were made with exactly this in mind; previously,
    changes had been made but in a less systematic manner and with
    more concern for not needing to update the existing content.  The
    result has been a highly structured and semantically loaded markup
    language implemented in <SPAN CLASS="logo,LaTeX">L<SUP><SMALL>A</SMALL></SUP>T<SMALL>E</SMALL>X</SPAN>.  With almost no basic <SPAN CLASS="logo-TeX">T<SMALL>E</SMALL>X</SPAN> or
    <SPAN CLASS="logo,LaTeX">L<SUP><SMALL>A</SMALL></SUP>T<SMALL>E</SMALL>X</SPAN> markup in use, however, the markup syntax is about the
    only evidence of <SPAN CLASS="logo,LaTeX">L<SUP><SMALL>A</SMALL></SUP>T<SMALL>E</SMALL>X</SPAN> in the actual document sources.

<P>
One side effect of this is that while we've been able to use
    standard ``engines'' for manipulating the documents, such as
    <SPAN CLASS="logo,LaTeX">L<SUP><SMALL>A</SMALL></SUP>T<SMALL>E</SMALL>X</SPAN> and <SPAN CLASS="logo,LaTeX">L<SUP><SMALL>A</SMALL></SUP>T<SMALL>E</SMALL>X</SPAN>2HTML, most of the actual transformations have
    been created specifically for Python.  The <SPAN CLASS="logo,LaTeX">L<SUP><SMALL>A</SMALL></SUP>T<SMALL>E</SMALL>X</SPAN> document
    classes and <SPAN CLASS="logo,LaTeX">L<SUP><SMALL>A</SMALL></SUP>T<SMALL>E</SMALL>X</SPAN>2HTML support are both complete implementations
    of the specific markup designed for these documents.

<P>
Combining highly customized markup with the somewhat esoteric
    systems used to process the documents leads us to ask some
    questions:  Can we do this more easily?  and, Can we do this
    better?  After a great deal of discussion with the community, we
    have determined that actively pursuing modern structured
    documentation systems is worth some investment of time.

<P>
There appear to be two real contenders in this arena: the Standard
    General Markup Language (SGML), and the Extensible Markup Language
    (XML).  Both of these standards have advantages and disadvantages,
    and many advantages are shared.

<P>
SGML offers advantages which may appeal most to authors,
    especially those using ordinary text editors.  There are also
    additional abilities to define content models.  A number of
    high-quality tools with demonstrated maturity is available, but
    most are not free; for those which are, portability issues remain
    a problem.

<P>
The advantages of XML include the availability of a large number
    of evolving tools.  Unfortunately, many of the associated
    standards are still evolving, and the tools will have to follow
    along.  This means that developing a robust tool set that uses
    more than the basic XML 1.0 recommendation is not possible in the
    short term.  The promised availability of a wide variety of
    high-quality tools which support some of the most important
    related standards is not immediate.  Many tools are likely to be
    free.

<P>
XXX Eventual migration to SGML/XML.
