<P>
<H1><A name=SECTION000200000000000000000>1 Introduction</A> </H1>
<P>A new release of Python, version 2.0, hass be released on October 16, 2000. 
This article covers the exciting new features in 2.0, highlights some other 
useful changes, and points out a few incompatible changes that may require 
rewriting code. 
<P>Python's development never completely stops between releases, and a steady 
flow of bug fixes and improvements are always being submitted. A host of minor 
fixes, a few optimizations, additional docstrings, and better error messages 
went into 2.0; to list them all would be impossible, but they're certainly 
significant. Consult the publicly-available CVS logs if you want to see the full 
list. This progress is due to the five developers working for PythonLabs are now 
getting paid to spend their days fixing bugs, and also due to the improved 
communication resulting from moving to SourceForge. 
<P>
<H1><A name=SECTION000300000000000000000>2 What About Python 1.6?</A> </H1>
<P>Python 1.6 can be thought of as the Contractual Obligations Python release. 
After the core development team left CNRI in May 2000, CNRI requested that a 1.6 
release be created, containing all the work on Python that had been performed at 
CNRI. Python 1.6 therefore represents the state of the CVS tree as of May 2000, 
with the most significant new feature being Unicode support. Development 
continued after May, of course, so the 1.6 tree received a few fixes to ensure 
that it's forward-compatible with Python 2.0. 1.6 is therefore part of Python's 
evolution, and not a side branch. 
<P>So, should you take much interest in Python 1.6? Probably not. The 1.6final 
and 2.0beta1 releases were made on the same day (September 5, 2000), the plan 
being to finalize Python 2.0 within a month or so. If you have applications to 
maintain, there seems little point in breaking things by moving to 1.6, fixing 
them, and then having another round of breakage within a month by moving to 2.0; 
you're better off just going straight to 2.0. Most of the really interesting 
features described in this document are only in 2.0, because a lot of work was 
done between May and September. 
<P>
<H1><A name=SECTION000400000000000000000>3 New Development Process</A> </H1>
<P>The most important change in Python 2.0 may not be to the code at all, but to 
how Python is developed: in May 2000 the Python developers began using the tools 
made available by SourceForge for storing source code, tracking bug reports, and 
managing the queue of patch submissions. To report bugs or submit patches for 
Python 2.0, use the bug tracking and patch manager tools available from Python's 
project page, located at <A class=url 
href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/python/">http://sourceforge.net/projects/python/</A>. 

<P>The most important of the services now hosted at SourceForge is the Python 
CVS tree, the version-controlled repository containing the source code for 
Python. Previously, there were roughly 7 or so people who had write access to 
the CVS tree, and all patches had to be inspected and checked in by one of the 
people on this short list. Obviously, this wasn't very scalable. By moving the 
CVS tree to SourceForge, it became possible to grant write access to more 
people; as of September 2000 there were 27 people able to check in changes, a 
fourfold increase. This makes possible large-scale changes that wouldn't be 
attempted if they'd have to be filtered through the small group of core 
developers. For example, one day Peter Schneider-Kamp took it into his head to 
drop K&amp;R C compatibility and convert the C source for Python to ANSI C. 
After getting approval on the python-dev mailing list, he launched into a flurry 
of checkins that lasted about a week, other developers joined in to help, and 
the job was done. If there were only 5 people with write access, probably that 
task would have been viewed as ``nice, but not worth the time and effort 
needed'' and it would never have gotten done. 
<P>The shift to using SourceForge's services has resulted in a remarkable 
increase in the speed of development. Patches now get submitted, commented on, 
revised by people other than the original submitter, and bounced back and forth 
between people until the patch is deemed worth checking in. Bugs are tracked in 
one central location and can be assigned to a specific person for fixing, and we 
can count the number of open bugs to measure progress. This didn't come without 
a cost: developers now have more e-mail to deal with, more mailing lists to 
follow, and special tools had to be written for the new environment. For 
example, SourceForge sends default patch and bug notification e-mail messages 
that are completely unhelpful, so Ka-Ping Yee wrote an HTML screen-scraper that 
sends more useful messages. 
<P>The ease of adding code caused a few initial growing pains, such as code was 
checked in before it was ready or without getting clear agreement from the 
developer group. The approval process that has emerged is somewhat similar to 
that used by the Apache group. Developers can vote +1, +0, -0, or -1 on a patch; 
+1 and -1 denote acceptance or rejection, while +0 and -0 mean the developer is 
mostly indifferent to the change, though with a slight positive or negative 
slant. The most significant change from the Apache model is that the voting is 
essentially advisory, letting Guido van Rossum, who has Benevolent Dictator For 
Life status, know what the general opinion is. He can still ignore the result of 
a vote, and approve or reject a change even if the community disagrees with him. 

<P>Producing an actual patch is the last step in adding a new feature, and is 
usually easy compared to the earlier task of coming up with a good design. 
Discussions of new features can often explode into lengthy mailing list threads, 
making the discussion hard to follow, and no one can read every posting to 
python-dev. Therefore, a relatively formal process has been set up to write 
Python Enhancement Proposals (PEPs), modelled on the Internet RFC process. PEPs 
are draft documents that describe a proposed new feature, and are continually 
revised until the community reaches a consensus, either accepting or rejecting 
the proposal. Quoting from the introduction to PEP 1, ``PEP Purpose and 
Guidelines'': 
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>PEP stands for Python Enhancement Proposal. A PEP is a design 
  document providing information to the Python community, or describing a new 
  feature for Python. The PEP should provide a concise technical specification 
  of the feature and a rationale for the feature. </BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>We intend PEPs to be the primary mechanisms for proposing new 
  features, for collecting community input on an issue, and for documenting the 
  design decisions that have gone into Python. The PEP author is responsible for 
  building consensus within the community and documenting dissenting opinions. 
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Read the rest of PEP 1 for the details of the PEP editorial process, style, 
and format. PEPs are kept in the Python CVS tree on SourceForge, though they're 
not part of the Python 2.0 distribution, and are also available in HTML form 
from <A class=url 
href="http://python.sourceforge.net/peps/">http://python.sourceforge.net/peps/</A>. 
As of September 2000, there are 25 PEPS, ranging from PEP 201, ``Lockstep 
Iteration'', to PEP 225, ``Elementwise/Objectwise Operators''. 
<P>
<H1><A name=SECTION000500000000000000000>4 Unicode</A> </H1>
<P>The largest new feature in Python 2.0 is a new fundamental data type: Unicode 
strings. Unicode uses 16-bit numbers to represent characters instead of the 
8-bit number used by ASCII, meaning that 65,536 distinct characters can be 
supported. 
<P>The final interface for Unicode support was arrived at through countless 
often-stormy discussions on the python-dev mailing list, and mostly implemented 
by Marc-André Lemburg, based on a Unicode string type implementation by Fredrik 
Lundh. A detailed explanation of the interface is in the file <SPAN 
class=file>Misc/unicode.txt</SPAN> in the Python source distribution; it's also 
available on the Web at <A class=url 
href="http://starship.python.net/crew/lemburg/unicode-proposal.txt">http://starship.python.net/crew/lemburg/unicode-proposal.txt</A>. 
This article will simply cover the most significant points about the Unicode 
interfaces. 
<P>In Python source code, Unicode strings are written as <CODE>u"string"</CODE>. 
Arbitrary Unicode characters can be written using a new escape sequence, 
<CODE>\u<VAR>HHHH</VAR></CODE>, where <VAR>HHHH</VAR> is a 4-digit hexadecimal 
number from 0000 to FFFF. The existing <CODE>\x<VAR>HHHH</VAR></CODE> escape 
sequence can also be used, and octal escapes can be used for characters up to 
U+01FF, which is represented by <CODE>\777</CODE>. 
<P>Unicode strings, just like regular strings, are an immutable sequence type. 
They can be indexed and sliced, but not modified in place. Unicode strings have 
an <TT class=method>encode( <BIG>[</BIG>encoding<BIG>]</BIG> )</TT> method that 
returns an 8-bit string in the desired encoding. Encodings are named by strings, 
such as <CODE>'ascii'</CODE>, <CODE>'utf-8'</CODE>, <CODE>'iso-8859-1'</CODE>, 
or whatever. A codec API is defined for implementing and registering new 
encodings that are then available throughout a Python program. If an encoding 
isn't specified, the default encoding is usually 7-bit ASCII, though it can be 
changed for your Python installation by calling the <TT 
class=function>sys.setdefaultencoding(<VAR>encoding</VAR>)</TT> function in a 
customised version of <SPAN class=file>site.py</SPAN>. 
<P>Combining 8-bit and Unicode strings always coerces to Unicode, using the 
default ASCII encoding; the result of <CODE>'a' + u'bc'</CODE> is 
<CODE>u'abc'</CODE>. 
<P>New built-in functions have been added, and existing built-ins modified to 
support Unicode: 
<P>
<UL>
  <LI><CODE>unichr(<VAR>ch</VAR>)</CODE> returns a Unicode string 1 character 
  long, containing the character <VAR>ch</VAR>. 
  <P></P>
  <LI><CODE>ord(<VAR>u</VAR>)</CODE>, where <VAR>u</VAR> is a 1-character 
  regular or Unicode string, returns the number of the character as an integer. 
  <P></P>
  <LI><CODE>unicode(<VAR>string</VAR> <BIG>[</BIG>, 
  <VAR>encoding</VAR><BIG>]</BIG> <BIG>[</BIG>, <VAR>errors</VAR><BIG>]</BIG> ) 
  </CODE>creates a Unicode string from an 8-bit string. <CODE>encoding</CODE> is 
  a string naming the encoding to use. The <CODE>errors</CODE> parameter 
  specifies the treatment of characters that are invalid for the current 
  encoding; passing <CODE>'strict'</CODE> as the value causes an exception to be 
  raised on any encoding error, while <CODE>'ignore'</CODE> causes errors to be 
  silently ignored and <CODE>'replace'</CODE> uses U+FFFD, the official 
  replacement character, in case of any problems. 
  <P></P>
  <LI>The <TT class=keyword>exec</TT> statement, and various built-ins such as 
  <CODE>eval()</CODE>, <CODE>getattr()</CODE>, and <CODE>setattr()</CODE> will 
  also accept Unicode strings as well as regular strings. (It's possible that 
  the process of fixing this missed some built-ins; if you find a built-in 
  function that accepts strings but doesn't accept Unicode strings at all, 
  please report it as a bug.) 
  <P></P></LI></UL>
<P>A new module, <TT class=module>unicodedata</TT>, provides an interface to 
Unicode character properties. For example, 
<CODE>unicodedata.category(u'A')</CODE> returns the 2-character string 'Lu', the 
'L' denoting it's a letter, and 'u' meaning that it's uppercase. 
<CODE>u.bidirectional(u'\x0660')</CODE> returns 'AN', meaning that U+0660 is an 
Arabic number. 
<P>The <TT class=module>codecs</TT> module contains functions to look up 
existing encodings and register new ones. Unless you want to implement a new 
encoding, you'll most often use the <TT 
class=function>codecs.lookup(<VAR>encoding</VAR>)</TT> function, which returns a 
4-element tuple: <CODE>(<VAR>encode_func</VAR>, <VAR>decode_func</VAR>, 
<VAR>stream_reader</VAR>, <VAR>stream_writer</VAR>)</CODE>. 
<P>
<UL>
  <LI><VAR>encode_func</VAR> is a function that takes a Unicode string, and 
  returns a 2-tuple <CODE>(<VAR>string</VAR>, <VAR>length</VAR>)</CODE>. 
  <VAR>string</VAR> is an 8-bit string containing a portion (perhaps all) of the 
  Unicode string converted into the given encoding, and <VAR>length</VAR> tells 
  you how much of the Unicode string was converted. 
  <P></P>
  <LI><VAR>decode_func</VAR> is the opposite of <VAR>encode_func</VAR>, taking 
  an 8-bit string and returning a 2-tuple <CODE>(<VAR>ustring</VAR>, 
  <VAR>length</VAR>)</CODE>, consisting of the resulting Unicode string 
  <VAR>ustring</VAR> and the integer <VAR>length</VAR> telling how much of the 
  8-bit string was consumed. 
  <P></P>
  <LI><VAR>stream_reader</VAR> is a class that supports decoding input from a 
  stream. <VAR>stream_reader(<VAR>file_obj</VAR>)</VAR> returns an object that 
  supports the <TT class=method>read()</TT>, <TT class=method>readline()</TT>, 
  and <TT class=method>readlines()</TT> methods. These methods will all 
  translate from the given encoding and return Unicode strings. 
  <P></P>
  <LI><VAR>stream_writer</VAR>, similarly, is a class that supports encoding 
  output to a stream. <VAR>stream_writer(<VAR>file_obj</VAR>)</VAR> returns an 
  object that supports the <TT class=method>write()</TT> and <TT 
  class=method>writelines()</TT> methods. These methods expect Unicode strings, 
  translating them to the given encoding on output. </LI></UL>
<P>For example, the following code writes a Unicode string into a file, encoding 
it as UTF-8: 
<P>
<DL>
  <DD><PRE class=verbatim>import codecs

unistr = u'\u0660\u2000ab ...'

(UTF8_encode, UTF8_decode,
 UTF8_streamreader, UTF8_streamwriter) = codecs.lookup('UTF-8')

output = UTF8_streamwriter( open( '/tmp/output', 'wb') )
output.write( unistr )
output.close()
</PRE></DD></DL>
<P>The following code would then read UTF-8 input from the file: 
<P>
<DL>
  <DD><PRE class=verbatim>input = UTF8_streamreader( open( '/tmp/output', 'rb') )
print repr(input.read())
input.close()
</PRE></DD></DL>
<P>Unicode-aware regular expressions are available through the <TT 
class=module>re</TT> module, which has a new underlying implementation called 
SRE written by Fredrik Lundh of Secret Labs AB. 
<P>A <CODE>-U</CODE> command line option was added which causes the Python 
compiler to interpret all string literals as Unicode string literals. This is 
intended to be used in testing and future-proofing your Python code, since some 
future version of Python may drop support for 8-bit strings and provide only 
Unicode strings. 
<P>
<H1><A name=SECTION000600000000000000000>5 List Comprehensions</A> </H1>
<P>Lists are a workhorse data type in Python, and many programs manipulate a 
list at some point. Two common operations on lists are to loop over them, and 
either pick out the elements that meet a certain criterion, or apply some 
function to each element. For example, given a list of strings, you might want 
to pull out all the strings containing a given substring, or strip off trailing 
whitespace from each line. 
<P>The existing <TT class=function>map()</TT> and <TT 
class=function>filter()</TT> functions can be used for this purpose, but they 
require a function as one of their arguments. This is fine if there's an 
existing built-in function that can be passed directly, but if there isn't, you 
have to create a little function to do the required work, and Python's scoping 
rules make the result ugly if the little function needs additional information. 
Take the first example in the previous paragraph, finding all the strings in the 
list containing a given substring. You could write the following to do it: 
<P>
<DL>
  <DD><PRE class=verbatim># Given the list L, make a list of all strings 
# containing the substring S.
sublist = filter( lambda s, substring=S: 
                     string.find(s, substring) != -1,
	          L)
</PRE></DD></DL>
<P>Because of Python's scoping rules, a default argument is used so that the 
anonymous function created by the <TT class=keyword>lambda</TT> statement knows 
what substring is being searched for. List comprehensions make this cleaner: 
<P>
<DL>
  <DD><PRE class=verbatim>sublist = [ s for s in L if string.find(s, S) != -1 ]
</PRE></DD></DL>
<P>List comprehensions have the form: 
<P>
<DL>
  <DD><PRE class=verbatim>[ expression for expr in sequence1 
             for expr2 in sequence2 ...
	     for exprN in sequenceN
             if condition
</PRE></DD></DL>
<P>The <TT class=keyword>for</TT>...<TT class=keyword>in</TT> clauses contain 
the sequences to be iterated over. The sequences do not have to be the same 
length, because they are <I>not</I> iterated over in parallel, but from left to 
right; this is explained more clearly in the following paragraphs. The elements 
of the generated list will be the successive values of <VAR>expression</VAR>. 
The final <TT class=keyword>if</TT> clause is optional; if present, 
<VAR>expression</VAR> is only evaluated and added to the result if 
<VAR>condition</VAR> is true. 
<P>To make the semantics very clear, a list comprehension is equivalent to the 
following Python code: 
<P>
<DL>
  <DD><PRE class=verbatim>for expr1 in sequence1:
    for expr2 in sequence2:
    ...
        for exprN in sequenceN:
             if (condition):
                  # Append the value of 
                  # the expression to the 
                  # resulting list.
</PRE></DD></DL>
<P>This means that when there are <TT class=keyword>for</TT>...<TT 
class=keyword>in</TT> clauses, the resulting list will be equal to the product 
of the lengths of all the sequences. If you have two lists of length 3, the 
output list is 9 elements long: 
<P>

<P>To avoid introducing an ambiguity into Python's grammar, if

<P>The idea of list comprehensions originally comes from the functional 
programming language Haskell (<A class=url 
href="http://www.haskell.org/">http://www.haskell.org/</A>). Greg Ewing argued 
most effectively for adding them to Python and wrote the initial list 
comprehension patch, which was then discussed for a seemingly endless time on 
the python-dev mailing list and kept up-to-date by Skip Montanaro. 
<P>
<H1><A name=SECTION000700000000000000000>6 Augmented Assignment</A> </H1>
<P>Augmented assignment operators, another long-requested feature, have been 
added to Python 2.0. Augmented assignment operators include <CODE>+=</CODE>, 
<CODE>-=</CODE>, <CODE>*=</CODE>, and so forth. For example, the statement 
<CODE>a += 2</CODE> increments the value of the variable <CODE>a</CODE> by 2, 
equivalent to the slightly lengthier <CODE>a = a + 2</CODE>. 
<P>The full list of supported assignment operators is <CODE>+=</CODE>, 
<CODE>-=</CODE>, <CODE>*=</CODE>, <CODE>/=</CODE>, <CODE>%=</CODE>, 
<CODE>**=</CODE>, <CODE>&amp;=</CODE>, <CODE>|=</CODE>, <CODE>^=</CODE>, 
<CODE>»=</CODE>, and <CODE>«=</CODE>. Python classes can override the augmented 
assignment operators by defining methods named <TT class=method>__iadd__</TT>, 
<TT class=method>__isub__</TT>, etc. For example, the following <TT 
class=class>Number</TT> class stores a number and supports using += to create a 
new instance with an incremented value. 
<P>
<DL>
  <DD><PRE class=verbatim>class Number:
    def __init__(self, value):
        self.value = value
    def __iadd__(self, increment):
	return Number( self.value + increment)

n = Number(5)
n += 3
print n.value
</PRE></DD></DL>
<P>The <TT class=method>__iadd__</TT> special method is called with the value of 
the increment, and should return a new instance with an appropriately modified 
value; this return value is bound as the new value of the variable on the 
left-hand side. 
<P>Augmented assignment operators were first introduced in the C programming 
language, and most C-derived languages, such as <B class=program>awk</B>, C++, 
Java, Perl, and PHP also support them. The augmented assignment patch was 
implemented by Thomas Wouters. 
<P>
<H1><A name=SECTION000800000000000000000>7 String Methods</A> </H1>
<P>Until now string-manipulation functionality was in the <TT 
class=module>string</TT> module, which was usually a front-end for the <TT 
class=module>strop</TT> module written in C. The addition of Unicode posed a 
difficulty for the <TT class=module>strop</TT> module, because the functions 
would all need to be rewritten in order to accept either 8-bit or Unicode 
strings. For functions such as <TT class=function>string.replace()</TT>, which 
takes 3 string arguments, that means eight possible permutations, and 
correspondingly complicated code. 
<P>Instead, Python 2.0 pushes the problem onto the string type, making string 
manipulation functionality available through methods on both 8-bit strings and 
Unicode strings. 
<P>
<DL>
  <DD><PRE class=verbatim>&gt;&gt;&gt; 'andrew'.capitalize()
'Andrew'
&gt;&gt;&gt; 'hostname'.replace('os', 'linux')
'hlinuxtname'
&gt;&gt;&gt; 'moshe'.find('sh')
2
</PRE></DD></DL>
<P>One thing that hasn't changed, a noteworthy April Fools' joke 
notwithstanding, is that Python strings are immutable. Thus, the string methods 
return new strings, and do not modify the string on which they operate. 
<P>The old <TT class=module>string</TT> module is still around for backwards 
compatibility, but it mostly acts as a front-end to the new string methods. 
<P>Two methods which have no parallel in pre-2.0 versions, although they did 
exist in JPython for quite some time, are <TT class=method>startswith()</TT> and 
<TT class=method>endswith</TT>. <CODE>s.startswith(t)</CODE> is equivalent to 
<CODE>s[:len(t)] == t</CODE>, while <CODE>s.endswith(t)</CODE> is equivalent to 
<CODE>s[-len(t):] == t</CODE>. 
<P>One other method which deserves special mention is <TT 
class=method>join</TT>. The <TT class=method>join</TT> method of a string 
receives one parameter, a sequence of strings, and is equivalent to the <TT 
class=function>string.join</TT> function from the old <TT 
class=module>string</TT> module, with the arguments reversed. In other words, 
<CODE>s.join(seq)</CODE> is equivalent to the old <CODE>string.join(seq, 
s)</CODE>. 
<P>
<H1><A name=SECTION000900000000000000000>8 Garbage Collection of Cycles</A> 
</H1>
<P>The C implementation of Python uses reference counting to implement garbage 
collection. Every Python object maintains a count of the number of references 
pointing to itself, and adjusts the count as references are created or 
destroyed. Once the reference count reaches zero, the object is no longer 
accessible, since you need to have a reference to an object to access it, and if 
the count is zero, no references exist any longer. 
<P>Reference counting has some pleasant properties: it's easy to understand and 
implement, and the resulting implementation is portable, fairly fast, and reacts 
well with other libraries that implement their own memory handling schemes. The 
major problem with reference counting is that it sometimes doesn't realise that 
objects are no longer accessible, resulting in a memory leak. This happens when 
there are cycles of references. 
<P>Consider the simplest possible cycle, a class instance which has a reference 
to itself: 
<P>
<DL>
  <DD><PRE class=verbatim>instance = SomeClass()
instance.myself = instance
</PRE></DD></DL>
<P>After the above two lines of code have been executed, the reference count of 
<CODE>instance</CODE> is 2; one reference is from the variable named "<TT 
class=samp>'instance'</TT>", and the other is from the "<TT 
class=samp>myself</TT>"attribute of the instance. 
<P>If the next line of code is <CODE>del instance</CODE>, what happens? The 
reference count of <CODE>instance</CODE> is decreased by 1, so it has a 
reference count of 1; the reference in the "<TT class=samp>myself</TT>" 
attribute still exists. Yet the instance is no longer accessible through Python 
code, and it could be deleted. Several objects can participate in a cycle if 
they have references to each other, causing all of the objects to be leaked. 
<P>Python 2.0 fixes this problem by periodically executing a cycle detection 
algorithm which looks for inaccessible cycles and deletes the objects involved. 
A new <TT class=module>gc</TT> module provides functions to perform a garbage 
collection, obtain debugging statistics, and tuning the collector's parameters. 
<P>Running the cycle detection algorithm takes some time, and therefore will 
result in some additional overhead. It is hoped that after we've gotten 
experience with the cycle collection from using 2.0, Python 2.1 will be able to 
minimize the overhead with careful tuning. It's not yet obvious how much 
performance is lost, because benchmarking this is tricky and depends crucially 
on how often the program creates and destroys objects. The detection of cycles 
can be disabled when Python is compiled, if you can't afford even a tiny speed 
penalty or suspect that the cycle collection is buggy, by specifying the "<TT 
class=samp>-without-cycle-gc</TT>" switch when running the <SPAN 
class=file>configure</SPAN> script. 
<P>Several people tackled this problem and contributed to a solution. An early 
implementation of the cycle detection approach was written by Toby Kelsey. The 
current algorithm was suggested by Eric Tiedemann during a visit to CNRI, and 
Guido van Rossum and Neil Schemenauer wrote two different implementations, which 
were later integrated by Neil. Lots of other people offered suggestions along 
the way; the March 2000 archives of the python-dev mailing list contain most of 
the relevant discussion, especially in the threads titled ``Reference cycle 
collection for Python'' and ``Finalization again''. 
<P>
<H1><A name=SECTION0001000000000000000000>9 Other Core Changes</A> </H1>
<P>Various minor changes have been made to Python's syntax and built-in 
functions. None of the changes are very far-reaching, but they're handy 
conveniences. 
<P>
<H2><A name=SECTION0001010000000000000000>9.1 Minor Language Changes</A> </H2>
<P>A new syntax makes it more convenient to call a given function with a tuple 
of arguments and/or a dictionary of keyword arguments. In Python 1.5 and 
earlier, you'd use the <TT class=function>apply()</TT> built-in function: 
<CODE>apply(f, <VAR>args</VAR>, <VAR>kw</VAR>)</CODE> calls the function <TT 
class=function>f()</TT> with the argument tuple <VAR>args</VAR> and the keyword 
arguments in the dictionary <VAR>kw</VAR>. <TT class=function>apply()</TT> is 
the same in 2.0, but thanks to a patch from Greg Ewing, 
<CODE>f(*<VAR>args</VAR>, **<VAR>kw</VAR>)</CODE> as a shorter and clearer way 
to achieve the same effect. This syntax is symmetrical with the syntax for 
defining functions: 
<P>
<DL>
  <DD><PRE class=verbatim>def f(*args, **kw):
    # args is a tuple of positional args,
    # kw is a dictionary of keyword args
    ...
</PRE></DD></DL>
<P>The <TT class=keyword>print</TT> statement can now have its output directed 
to a file-like object by following the <TT class=keyword>print</TT> with 
<CODE>&gt;&gt; file</CODE>, similar to the redirection operator in Unix shells. 
Previously you'd either have to use the <TT class=method>write()</TT> method of 
the file-like object, which lacks the convenience and simplicity of <TT 
class=keyword>print</TT>, or you could assign a new value to 
<CODE>sys.stdout</CODE> and then restore the old value. For sending output to 
standard error, it's much easier to write this: 
<P>
<DL>
  <DD><PRE class=verbatim>print &gt;&gt; sys.stderr, "Warning: action field not supplied"
</PRE></DD></DL>
<P>Modules can now be renamed on importing them, using the syntax <CODE>import 
<VAR>module</VAR> as <VAR>name</VAR></CODE> or <CODE>from <VAR>module</VAR> 
import <VAR>name</VAR> as <VAR>othername</VAR></CODE>. The patch was submitted 
by Thomas Wouters. 
<P>A new format style is available when using the <CODE>%</CODE> operator; '%r' 
will insert the <TT class=function>repr()</TT> of its argument. This was also 
added from symmetry considerations, this time for symmetry with the existing 
'%s' format style, which inserts the <TT class=function>str()</TT> of its 
argument. For example, <CODE>'%r %s' % ('abc', 'abc')</CODE> returns a string 
containing <CODE>'abc' abc</CODE>. 
<P>Previously there was no way to implement a class that overrode Python's 
built-in <TT class=keyword>in</TT> operator and implemented a custom version. 
<CODE><VAR>obj</VAR> in <VAR>seq</VAR></CODE> returns true if <VAR>obj</VAR> is 
present in the sequence <VAR>seq</VAR>; Python computes this by simply trying 
every index of the sequence until either <VAR>obj</VAR> is found or an <TT 
class=exception>IndexError</TT> is encountered. Moshe Zadka contributed a patch 
which adds a <TT class=method>__contains__</TT> magic method for providing a 
custom implementation for <TT class=keyword>in</TT>. Additionally, new built-in 
objects written in C can define what <TT class=keyword>in</TT> means for them 
via a new slot in the sequence protocol. 
<P>Earlier versions of Python used a recursive algorithm for deleting objects. 
Deeply nested data structures could cause the interpreter to fill up the C stack 
and crash; Christian Tismer rewrote the deletion logic to fix this problem. On a 
related note, comparing recursive objects recursed infinitely and crashed; 
Jeremy Hylton rewrote the code to no longer crash, producing a useful result 
instead. For example, after this code: 
<P>
<DL>
  <DD><PRE class=verbatim>a = []
b = []
a.append(a)
b.append(b)
</PRE></DD></DL>
<P>The comparison <CODE>a==b</CODE> returns true, because the two recursive data 
structures are isomorphic. See the thread ``trashcan and PR#7'' in the April 
2000 archives of the python-dev mailing list for the discussion leading up to 
this implementation, and some useful relevant links. 
<P>Note that comparisons can now also raise exceptions. In earlier versions of 
Python, a comparison operation such as <CODE>cmp(a,b)</CODE> would always 
produce an answer, even if a user-defined <TT class=method>__cmp__</TT> method 
encountered an error, since the resulting exception would simply be silently 
swallowed. 
<P>Work has been done on porting Python to 64-bit Windows on the Itanium 
processor, mostly by Trent Mick of ActiveState. (Confusingly, 
<CODE>sys.platform</CODE> is still <CODE>'win32'</CODE> on Win64 because it 
seems that for ease of porting, MS Visual C++ treats code as 32 bit on Itanium.) 
PythonWin also supports Windows CE; see the Python CE page at <A class=url 
href="http://starship.python.net/crew/mhammond/ce/">http://starship.python.net/crew/mhammond/ce/</A> 
for more information. 
<P>Another new platform is Darwin/MacOS X; inital support for it is in Python 
2.0. Dynamic loading works, if you specify ``configure -with-dyld 
-with-suffix=.x''. Consult the README in the Python source distribution for more 
instructions. 
<P>An attempt has been made to alleviate one of Python's warts, the 
often-confusing <TT class=exception>NameError</TT> exception when code refers to 
a local variable before the variable has been assigned a value. For example, the 
following code raises an exception on the <TT class=keyword>print</TT> statement 
in both 1.5.2 and 2.0; in 1.5.2 a <TT class=exception>NameError</TT> exception 
is raised, while 2.0 raises a new <TT class=exception>UnboundLocalError</TT> 
exception. <TT class=exception>UnboundLocalError</TT> is a subclass of <TT 
class=exception>NameError</TT>, so any existing code that expects <TT 
class=exception>NameError</TT> to be raised should still work. 
<P>
<DL>
  <DD><PRE class=verbatim>def f():
    print "i=",i
    i = i + 1 
f()
</PRE></DD></DL>
<P>Two new exceptions, <TT class=exception>TabError</TT> and <TT 
class=exception>IndentationError</TT>, have been introduced. They're both 
subclasses of <TT class=exception>SyntaxError</TT>, and are raised when Python 
code is found to be improperly indented. 
<P>
<H2><A name=SECTION0001020000000000000000>9.2 Changes to Built-in Functions</A> 
</H2>
<P>A new built-in, <TT class=function>zip(<VAR>seq1</VAR>, <VAR>seq2</VAR>, 
...)</TT>, has been added. <TT class=function>zip()</TT> returns a list of 
tuples where each tuple contains the i-th element from each of the argument 
sequences. The difference between <TT class=function>zip()</TT> and 
<CODE>map(None, <VAR>seq1</VAR>, <VAR>seq2</VAR>)</CODE> is that <TT 
class=function>map()</TT> pads the sequences with <CODE>None</CODE> if the 
sequences aren't all of the same length, while <TT class=function>zip()</TT> 
truncates the returned list to the length of the shortest argument sequence. 
<P>The <TT class=function>int()</TT> and <TT class=function>long()</TT> 
functions now accept an optional ``base'' parameter when the first argument is a 
string. <CODE>int('123', 10)</CODE> returns 123, while <CODE>int('123', 
16)</CODE> returns 291. <CODE>int(123, 16)</CODE> raises a <TT 
class=exception>TypeError</TT> exception with the message ``can't convert 
non-string with explicit base''. 
<P>A new variable holding more detailed version information has been added to 
the <TT class=module>sys</TT> module. <CODE>sys.version_info</CODE> is a tuple 
<CODE>(<VAR>major</VAR>, <VAR>minor</VAR>, <VAR>micro</VAR>, <VAR>level</VAR>, 
<VAR>serial</VAR>)</CODE> For example, in a hypothetical 2.0.1beta1, 
<CODE>sys.version_info</CODE> would be <CODE>(2, 0, 1, 'beta', 1)</CODE>. 
<VAR>level</VAR> is a string such as <CODE>"alpha"</CODE>, <CODE>"beta"</CODE>, 
or <CODE>"final"</CODE> for a final release. 
<P>Dictionaries have an odd new method, <TT 
class=method>setdefault(<VAR>key</VAR>, <VAR>default</VAR>)</TT>, which behaves 
similarly to the existing <TT class=method>get()</TT> method. However, if the 
key is missing, <TT class=method>setdefault()</TT> both returns the value of 
<VAR>default</VAR> as <TT class=method>get()</TT> would do, and also inserts it 
into the dictionary as the value for <VAR>key</VAR>. Thus, the following lines 
of code: 
<P>
<DL>
  <DD><PRE class=verbatim>if dict.has_key( key ): return dict[key]
else: 
    dict[key] = []
    return dict[key]
</PRE></DD></DL>
<P>can be reduced to a single <CODE>return dict.setdefault(key, [])</CODE> 
statement. 
<P>The interpreter sets a maximum recursion depth in order to catch runaway 
recursion before filling the C stack and causing a core dump or GPF.. Previously 
this limit was fixed when you compiled Python, but in 2.0 the maximum recursion 
depth can be read and modified using <TT 
class=function>sys.getrecursionlimit</TT> and <TT 
class=function>sys.setrecursionlimit</TT>. The default value is 1000, and a 
rough maximum value for a given platform can be found by running a new script, 
<SPAN class=file>Misc/find_recursionlimit.py</SPAN>. 
<P>
<H1><A name=SECTION0001100000000000000000>10 Porting to 2.0</A> </H1>
<P>New Python releases try hard to be compatible with previous releases, and the 
record has been pretty good. However, some changes are considered useful enough, 
usually because they fix initial design decisions that turned out to be actively 
mistaken, that breaking backward compatibility can't always be avoided. This 
section lists the changes in Python 2.0 that may cause old Python code to break. 

<P>The change which will probably break the most code is tightening up the 
arguments accepted by some methods. Some methods would take multiple arguments 
and treat them as a tuple, particularly various list methods such as <TT 
class=method>.append()</TT> and <TT class=method>.insert()</TT>. In earlier 
versions of Python, if <CODE>L</CODE> is a list, <CODE>L.append( 1,2 )</CODE> 
appends the tuple <CODE>(1,2)</CODE> to the list. In Python 2.0 this causes a 
<TT class=exception>TypeError</TT> exception to be raised, with the message: 
'append requires exactly 1 argument; 2 given'. The fix is to simply add an extra 
set of parentheses to pass both values as a tuple: <CODE>L.append( (1,2) 
)</CODE>. 
<P>The earlier versions of these methods were more forgiving because they used 
an old function in Python's C interface to parse their arguments; 2.0 modernizes 
them to use <TT class=function>PyArg_ParseTuple</TT>, the current argument 
parsing function, which provides more helpful error messages and treats 
multi-argument calls as errors. If you absolutely must use 2.0 but can't fix 
your code, you can edit <SPAN class=file>Objects/listobject.c</SPAN> and define 
the preprocessor symbol <CODE>NO_STRICT_LIST_APPEND</CODE> to preserve the old 
behaviour; this isn't recommended. 
<P>Some of the functions in the <TT class=module>socket</TT> module are still 
forgiving in this way. For example, <TT class=function>socket.connect( 
('hostname', 25) )</TT> is the correct form, passing a tuple representing an IP 
address, but <TT class=function>socket.connect( 'hostname', 25 )</TT> also 
works. <TT class=function>socket.connect_ex()</TT> and <TT 
class=function>socket.bind()</TT> are similarly easy-going. 2.0alpha1 tightened 
these functions up, but because the documentation actually used the erroneous 
multiple argument form, many people wrote code which would break with the 
stricter checking. GvR backed out the changes in the face of public reaction, so 
for the <TT class=module>socket</TT> module, the documentation was fixed and the 
multiple argument form is simply marked as deprecated; it <I>will</I> be 
tightened up again in a future Python version. 
<P>The <CODE>\x</CODE> escape in string literals now takes exactly 2 hex digits. 
Previously it would consume all the hex digits following the 'x' and take the 
lowest 8 bits of the result, so <CODE>\x123456</CODE> was equivalent to 
<CODE>\x56</CODE>. 
<P>The <TT class=exception>AttributeError</TT> exception has a more friendly 
error message, whose text will be something like <CODE>'Spam' instance has no 
attribute 'eggs'</CODE>. Previously the error message was just the missing 
attribute name <CODE>eggs</CODE>, and code written to take advantage of this 
fact will break in 2.0. 
<P>Some work has been done to make integers and long integers a bit more 
interchangeable. In 1.5.2, large-file support was added for Solaris, to allow 
reading files larger than 2Gb; this made the <TT class=method>tell()</TT> method 
of file objects return a long integer instead of a regular integer. Some code 
would subtract two file offsets and attempt to use the result to multiply a 
sequence or slice a string, but this raised a <TT 
class=exception>TypeError</TT>. In 2.0, long integers can be used to multiply or 
slice a sequence, and it'll behave as you'd intuitively expect it to; <CODE>3L * 
'abc'</CODE> produces 'abcabcabc', and <CODE>(0,1,2,3)[2L:4L]</CODE> produces 
(2,3). Long integers can also be used in various contexts where previously only 
integers were accepted, such as in the <TT class=method>seek()</TT> method of 
file objects, and in the formats supported by the <CODE>%</CODE> operator 
(<CODE>%d</CODE>, <CODE>%i</CODE>, <CODE>%x</CODE>, etc.). For example, 
<CODE>"%d" % 2L**64</CODE> will produce the string "<TT 
class=samp>18446744073709551616</TT>". 
<P>The subtlest long integer change of all is that the <TT 
class=function>str()</TT> of a long integer no longer has a trailing 'L' 
character, though <TT class=function>repr()</TT> still includes it. The 'L' 
annoyed many people who wanted to print long integers that looked just like 
regular integers, since they had to go out of their way to chop off the 
character. This is no longer a problem in 2.0, but code which does 
<CODE>str(longval)[:-1]</CODE> and assumes the 'L' is there, will now lose the 
final digit. 
<P>Taking the <TT class=function>repr()</TT> of a float now uses a different 
formatting precision than <TT class=function>str()</TT>. <TT 
class=function>repr()</TT> uses <CODE>%.17g</CODE> format string for C's <TT 
class=function>sprintf()</TT>, while <TT class=function>str()</TT> uses 
<CODE>%.12g</CODE> as before. The effect is that <TT class=function>repr()</TT> 
may occasionally show more decimal places than <TT class=function>str()</TT>, 
for certain numbers. For example, the number 8.1 can't be represented exactly in 
binary, so <CODE>repr(8.1)</CODE> is <CODE>'8.0999999999999996'</CODE>, while 
str(8.1) is <CODE>'8.1'</CODE>. 
<P>The <CODE>-X</CODE> command-line option, which turned all standard exceptions 
into strings instead of classes, has been removed; the standard exceptions will 
now always be classes. The <TT class=module>exceptions</TT> module containing 
the standard exceptions was translated from Python to a built-in C module, 
written by Barry Warsaw and Fredrik Lundh. 
<P>
<H1><A name=SECTION0001200000000000000000>11 Extending/Embedding Changes</A> 
</H1>
<P>Some of the changes are under the covers, and will only be apparent to people 
writing C extension modules or embedding a Python interpreter in a larger 
application. If you aren't dealing with Python's C API, you can safely skip this 
section. 
<P>The version number of the Python C API was incremented, so C extensions 
compiled for 1.5.2 must be recompiled in order to work with 2.0. On Windows, 
it's not possible for Python 2.0 to import a third party extension built for 
Python 1.5.x due to how Windows DLLs work, so Python will raise an exception and 
the import will fail. 
<P>Users of Jim Fulton's ExtensionClass module will be pleased to find out that 
hooks have been added so that ExtensionClasses are now supported by <TT 
class=function>isinstance()</TT> and <TT class=function>issubclass()</TT>. This 
means you no longer have to remember to write code such as <CODE>if type(obj) == 
myExtensionClass</CODE>, but can use the more natural <CODE>if isinstance(obj, 
myExtensionClass)</CODE>. 
<P>The <SPAN class=file>Python/importdl.c</SPAN> file, which was a mass of 
#ifdefs to support dynamic loading on many different platforms, was cleaned up 
and reorganised by Greg Stein. <SPAN class=file>importdl.c</SPAN> is now quite 
small, and platform-specific code has been moved into a bunch of <SPAN 
class=file>Python/dynload_*.c</SPAN> files. Another cleanup: there were also a 
number of <SPAN class=file>my*.h</SPAN> files in the Include/ directory that 
held various portability hacks; they've been merged into a single file, <SPAN 
class=file>Include/pyport.h</SPAN>. 
<P>Vladimir Marangozov's long-awaited malloc restructuring was completed, to 
make it easy to have the Python interpreter use a custom allocator instead of 
C's standard <TT class=function>malloc()</TT>. For documentation, read the 
comments in <SPAN class=file>Include/pymem.h</SPAN> and <SPAN 
class=file>Include/objimpl.h</SPAN>. For the lengthy discussions during which 
the interface was hammered out, see the Web archives of the 'patches' and 
'python-dev' lists at python.org. 
<P>Recent versions of the GUSI development environment for MacOS support POSIX 
threads. Therefore, Python's POSIX threading support now works on the Macintosh. 
Threading support using the user-space GNU <TT>pth</TT> library was also 
contributed. 
<P>Threading support on Windows was enhanced, too. Windows supports thread locks 
that use kernel objects only in case of contention; in the common case when 
there's no contention, they use simpler functions which are an order of 
magnitude faster. A threaded version of Python 1.5.2 on NT is twice as slow as 
an unthreaded version; with the 2.0 changes, the difference is only 10%. These 
improvements were contributed by Yakov Markovitch. 
<P>Python 2.0's source now uses only ANSI C prototypes, so compiling Python now 
requires an ANSI C compiler, and can no longer be done using a compiler that 
only supports K&amp;R C. 
<P>Previously the Python virtual machine used 16-bit numbers in its bytecode, 
limiting the size of source files. In particular, this affected the maximum size 
of literal lists and dictionaries in Python source; occasionally people who are 
generating Python code would run into this limit. A patch by Charles G. Waldman 
raises the limit from <CODE>2^16</CODE> to <CODE>2^{32}</CODE>. 
<P>Three new convenience functions intended for adding constants to a module's 
dictionary at module initialization time were added: <TT 
class=function>PyModule_AddObject()</TT>, <TT 
class=function>PyModule_AddIntConstant()</TT>, and <TT 
class=function>PyModule_AddStringConstant()</TT>. Each of these functions takes 
a module object, a null-terminated C string containing the name to be added, and 
a third argument for the value to be assigned to the name. This third argument 
is, respectively, a Python object, a C long, or a C string. 
<P>A wrapper API was added for Unix-style signal handlers. <TT 
class=function>PyOS_getsig()</TT> gets a signal handler and <TT 
class=function>PyOS_setsig()</TT> will set a new handler. 
<P>
<H1><A name=SECTION0001300000000000000000>12 Distutils: Making Modules Easy to 
Install</A> </H1>
<P>Before Python 2.0, installing modules was a tedious affair - there was no way 
to figure out automatically where Python is installed, or what compiler options 
to use for extension modules. Software authors had to go through an arduous 
ritual of editing Makefiles and configuration files, which only really work on 
Unix and leave Windows and MacOS unsupported. Python users faced wildly 
differing installation instructions which varied between different extension 
packages, which made adminstering a Python installation something of a chore. 
<P>The SIG for distribution utilities, shepherded by Greg Ward, has created the 
Distutils, a system to make package installation much easier. They form the <TT 
class=module>distutils</TT> package, a new part of Python's standard library. In 
the best case, installing a Python module from source will require the same 
steps: first you simply mean unpack the tarball or zip archive, and the run 
``<CODE>python setup.py install</CODE>''. The platform will be automatically 
detected, the compiler will be recognized, C extension modules will be compiled, 
and the distribution installed into the proper directory. Optional command-line 
arguments provide more control over the installation process, the distutils 
package offers many places to override defaults - separating the build from the 
install, building or installing in non-default directories, and more. 
<P>In order to use the Distutils, you need to write a <SPAN 
class=file>setup.py</SPAN> script. For the simple case, when the software 
contains only .py files, a minimal <SPAN class=file>setup.py</SPAN> can be just 
a few lines long: 
<P>
<DL>
  <DD><PRE class=verbatim>from distutils.core import setup
setup (name = "foo", version = "1.0", 
       py_modules = ["module1", "module2"])
</PRE></DD></DL>
<P>The <SPAN class=file>setup.py</SPAN> file isn't much more complicated if the 
software consists of a few packages: 
<P>
<DL>
  <DD><PRE class=verbatim>from distutils.core import setup
setup (name = "foo", version = "1.0", 
       packages = ["package", "package.subpackage"])
</PRE></DD></DL>
<P>A C extension can be the most complicated case; here's an example taken from 
the PyXML package: 
<P>
<DL>
  <DD><PRE class=verbatim>from distutils.core import setup, Extension

expat_extension = Extension('xml.parsers.pyexpat',
	define_macros = [('XML_NS', None)],
	include_dirs = [ 'extensions/expat/xmltok',
	                 'extensions/expat/xmlparse' ],
	sources = [ 'extensions/pyexpat.c',
	            'extensions/expat/xmltok/xmltok.c',
 		    'extensions/expat/xmltok/xmlrole.c',
                  ]
       )
setup (name = "PyXML", version = "0.5.4", 
       ext_modules =[ expat_extension ] )
</PRE></DD></DL>
<P>The Distutils can also take care of creating source and binary distributions. 
The ``sdist'' command, run by ``<CODE>python setup.py sdist</CODE>', builds a 
source distribution such as <SPAN class=file>foo-1.0.tar.gz</SPAN>. Adding new 
commands isn't difficult, ``bdist_rpm'' and ``bdist_wininst'' commands have 
already been contributed to create an RPM distribution and a Windows installer 
for the software, respectively. Commands to create other distribution formats 
such as Debian packages and Solaris <SPAN class=file>.pkg</SPAN> files are in 
various stages of development. 
<P>All this is documented in a new manual, <I>Distributing Python Modules</I>, 
that joins the basic set of Python documentation. 
<P>
<H1><A name=SECTION0001400000000000000000>13 XML Modules</A> </H1>
<P>Python 1.5.2 included a simple XML parser in the form of the <TT 
class=module>xmllib</TT> module, contributed by Sjoerd Mullender. Since 1.5.2's 
release, two different interfaces for processing XML have become common: SAX2 
(version 2 of the Simple API for XML) provides an event-driven interface with 
some similarities to <TT class=module>xmllib</TT>, and the DOM (Document Object 
Model) provides a tree-based interface, transforming an XML document into a tree 
of nodes that can be traversed and modified. Python 2.0 includes a SAX2 
interface and a stripped-down DOM interface as part of the <TT 
class=module>xml</TT> package. Here we will give a brief overview of these new 
interfaces; consult the Python documentation or the source code for complete 
details. The Python XML SIG is also working on improved documentation. 
<P>
<H2><A name=SECTION0001410000000000000000>13.1 SAX2 Support</A> </H2>
<P>SAX defines an event-driven interface for parsing XML. To use SAX, you must 
write a SAX handler class. Handler classes inherit from various classes provided 
by SAX, and override various methods that will then be called by the XML parser. 
For example, the <TT class=method>startElement</TT> and <TT 
class=method>endElement</TT> methods are called for every starting and end tag 
encountered by the parser, the <TT class=method>characters()</TT> method is 
called for every chunk of character data, and so forth. 
<P>The advantage of the event-driven approach is that that the whole document 
doesn't have to be resident in memory at any one time, which matters if you are 
processing really huge documents. However, writing the SAX handler class can get 
very complicated if you're trying to modify the document structure in some 
elaborate way. 
<P>For example, this little example program defines a handler that prints a 
message for every starting and ending tag, and then parses the file <SPAN 
class=file>hamlet.xml</SPAN> using it: 
<P>
<DL>
  <DD><PRE class=verbatim>from xml import sax

class SimpleHandler(sax.ContentHandler):
    def startElement(self, name, attrs):
        print 'Start of element:', name, attrs.keys()

    def endElement(self, name):
        print 'End of element:', name

# Create a parser object
parser = sax.make_parser()

# Tell it what handler to use
handler = SimpleHandler()
parser.setContentHandler( handler )

# Parse a file!
parser.parse( 'hamlet.xml' )
</PRE></DD></DL>
<P>For more information, consult the Python documentation, or the XML HOWTO at 
<A class=url 
href="http://www.python.org/doc/howto/xml/">http://www.python.org/doc/howto/xml/</A>. 

<P>
<H2><A name=SECTION0001420000000000000000>13.2 DOM Support</A> </H2>
<P>The Document Object Model is a tree-based representation for an XML document. 
A top-level <TT class=class>Document</TT> instance is the root of the tree, and 
has a single child which is the top-level <TT class=class>Element</TT> instance. 
This <TT class=class>Element</TT> has children nodes representing character data 
and any sub-elements, which may have further children of their own, and so 
forth. Using the DOM you can traverse the resulting tree any way you like, 
access element and attribute values, insert and delete nodes, and convert the 
tree back into XML. 
<P>The DOM is useful for modifying XML documents, because you can create a DOM 
tree, modify it by adding new nodes or rearranging subtrees, and then produce a 
new XML document as output. You can also construct a DOM tree manually and 
convert it to XML, which can be a more flexible way of producing XML output than 
simply writing <CODE>&lt;tag1&gt;</CODE>...<CODE>&lt;/tag1&gt;</CODE> to a file. 

<P>The DOM implementation included with Python lives in the <TT 
class=module>xml.dom.minidom</TT> module. It's a lightweight implementation of 
the Level 1 DOM with support for XML namespaces. The <TT 
class=function>parse()</TT> and <TT class=function>parseString()</TT> 
convenience functions are provided for generating a DOM tree: 
<P>
<DL>
  <DD><PRE class=verbatim>from xml.dom import minidom
doc = minidom.parse('hamlet.xml')
</PRE></DD></DL>
<P><CODE>doc</CODE> is a <TT class=class>Document</TT> instance. <TT 
class=class>Document</TT>, like all the other DOM classes such as <TT 
class=class>Element</TT> and <TT class=class>Text</TT>, is a subclass of the <TT 
class=class>Node</TT> base class. All the nodes in a DOM tree therefore support 
certain common methods, such as <TT class=method>toxml()</TT> which returns a 
string containing the XML representation of the node and its children. Each 
class also has special methods of its own; for example, <TT 
class=class>Element</TT> and <TT class=class>Document</TT> instances have a 
method to find all child elements with a given tag name. Continuing from the 
previous 2-line example: 
<P>
<DL>
  <DD><PRE class=verbatim>perslist = doc.getElementsByTagName( 'PERSONA' )
print perslist[0].toxml()
print perslist[1].toxml()
</PRE></DD></DL>
<P>For the <I>Hamlet</I> XML file, the above few lines output: 
<P>
<DL>
  <DD><PRE class=verbatim>&lt;PERSONA&gt;CLAUDIUS, king of Denmark. &lt;/PERSONA&gt;
&lt;PERSONA&gt;HAMLET, son to the late, and nephew to the present king.&lt;/PERSONA&gt;
</PRE></DD></DL>
<P>The root element of the document is available as 
<CODE>doc.documentElement</CODE>, and its children can be easily modified by 
deleting, adding, or removing nodes: 
<P>
<DL>
  <DD><PRE class=verbatim>root = doc.documentElement

# Remove the first child
root.removeChild( root.childNodes[0] )

# Move the new first child to the end
root.appendChild( root.childNodes[0] )

# Insert the new first child (originally,
# the third child) before the 20th child.
root.insertBefore( root.childNodes[0], root.childNodes[20] )
</PRE></DD></DL>
<P>Again, I will refer you to the Python documentation for a complete listing of 
the different <TT class=class>Node</TT> classes and their various methods. 
<P>
<H2><A name=SECTION0001430000000000000000>13.3 Relationship to PyXML</A> </H2>
<P>The XML Special Interest Group has been working on XML-related Python code 
for a while. Its code distribution, called PyXML, is available from the SIG's 
Web pages at <A class=url 
href="http://www.python.org/sigs/xml-sig/">http://www.python.org/sigs/xml-sig/</A>. 
The PyXML distribution also used the package name "<TT class=samp>xml</TT>". If 
you've written programs that used PyXML, you're probably wondering about its 
compatibility with the 2.0 <TT class=module>xml</TT> package. 
<P>The answer is that Python 2.0's <TT class=module>xml</TT> package isn't 
compatible with PyXML, but can be made compatible by installing a recent version 
PyXML. Many applications can get by with the XML support that is included with 
Python 2.0, but more complicated applications will require that the full PyXML 
package will be installed. When installed, PyXML versions 0.6.0 or greater will 
replace the <TT class=module>xml</TT> package shipped with Python, and will be a 
strict superset of the standard package, adding a bunch of additional features. 
Some of the additional features in PyXML include: 
<P>
<UL>
  <LI>4DOM, a full DOM implementation from FourThought, Inc. 
  <LI>The xmlproc validating parser, written by Lars Marius Garshol. 
  <LI>The <TT class=module>sgmlop</TT> parser accelerator module, written by 
  Fredrik Lundh. </LI></UL>
<P>
<H1><A name=SECTION0001500000000000000000>14 Module changes</A> </H1>
<P>Lots of improvements and bugfixes were made to Python's extensive standard 
library; some of the affected modules include <TT class=module>readline</TT>, 
<TT class=module>ConfigParser</TT>, <TT class=module>cgi</TT>, <TT 
class=module>calendar</TT>, <TT class=module>posix</TT>, <TT 
class=module>readline</TT>, <TT class=module>xmllib</TT>, <TT 
class=module>aifc</TT>, <TT class=module>chunk, wave</TT>, <TT 
class=module>random</TT>, <TT class=module>shelve</TT>, and <TT 
class=module>nntplib</TT>. Consult the CVS logs for the exact patch-by-patch 
details. 
<P>Brian Gallew contributed OpenSSL support for the <TT class=module>socket</TT> 
module. OpenSSL is an implementation of the Secure Socket Layer, which encrypts 
the data being sent over a socket. When compiling Python, you can edit <SPAN 
class=file>Modules/Setup</SPAN> to include SSL support, which adds an additional 
function to the <TT class=module>socket</TT> module: <TT 
class=function>socket.ssl(<VAR>socket</VAR>, <VAR>keyfile</VAR>, 
<VAR>certfile</VAR>)</TT>, which takes a socket object and returns an SSL 
socket. The <TT class=module>httplib</TT> and <TT class=module>urllib</TT> 
modules were also changed to support ``https://'' URLs, though no one has 
implemented FTP or SMTP over SSL. 
<P>The <TT class=module>httplib</TT> module has been rewritten by Greg Stein to 
support HTTP/1.1. Backward compatibility with the 1.5 version of <TT 
class=module>httplib</TT> is provided, though using HTTP/1.1 features such as 
pipelining will require rewriting code to use a different set of interfaces. 
<P>The <TT class=module>Tkinter</TT> module now supports Tcl/Tk version 8.1, 
8.2, or 8.3, and support for the older 7.x versions has been dropped. The 
Tkinter module now supports displaying Unicode strings in Tk widgets. Also, 
Fredrik Lundh contributed an optimization which makes operations like 
<CODE>create_line</CODE> and <CODE>create_polygon</CODE> much faster, especially 
when using lots of coordinates. 
<P>The <TT class=module>curses</TT> module has been greatly extended, starting 
from Oliver Andrich's enhanced version, to provide many additional functions 
from ncurses and SYSV curses, such as colour, alternative character set support, 
pads, and mouse support. This means the module is no longer compatible with 
operating systems that only have BSD curses, but there don't seem to be any 
currently maintained OSes that fall into this category. 
<P>As mentioned in the earlier discussion of 2.0's Unicode support, the 
underlying implementation of the regular expressions provided by the <TT 
class=module>re</TT> module has been changed. SRE, a new regular expression 
engine written by Fredrik Lundh and partially funded by Hewlett Packard, 
supports matching against both 8-bit strings and Unicode strings. 
<P>
<H1><A name=SECTION0001600000000000000000>15 New modules</A> </H1>
<P>A number of new modules were added. We'll simply list them with brief 
descriptions; consult the 2.0 documentation for the details of a particular 
module. 
<P>
<UL>
  <LI><TT class=module>atexit</TT>: For registering functions to be called 
  before the Python interpreter exits. Code that currently sets 
  <CODE>sys.exitfunc</CODE> directly should be changed to use the <TT 
  class=module>atexit</TT> module instead, importing <TT 
  class=module>atexit</TT> and calling <TT class=function>atexit.register()</TT> 
  with the function to be called on exit. (Contributed by Skip Montanaro.) 
  <P></P>
  <LI><TT class=module>codecs</TT>, <TT class=module>encodings</TT>, <TT 
  class=module>unicodedata</TT>: Added as part of the new Unicode support. 
  <P></P>
  <LI><TT class=module>filecmp</TT>: Supersedes the old <TT 
  class=module>cmp</TT>, <TT class=module>cmpcache</TT> and <TT 
  class=module>dircmp</TT> modules, which have now become deprecated. 
  (Contributed by Gordon MacMillan and Moshe Zadka.) 
  <P></P>
  <LI><TT class=module>gettext</TT>: This module provides internationalization 
  (I18N) and localization (L10N) support for Python programs by providing an 
  interface to the GNU gettext message catalog library. (Integrated by Barry 
  Warsaw, from separate contributions by Martin von Loewis, Peter Funk, and 
  James Henstridge.) 
  <P></P>
  <LI><TT class=module>linuxaudiodev</TT>: Support for the <SPAN 
  class=file>/dev/audio</SPAN> device on Linux, a twin to the existing <TT 
  class=module>sunaudiodev</TT> module. (Contributed by Peter Bosch, with fixes 
  by Jeremy Hylton.) 
  <P></P>
  <LI><TT class=module>mmap</TT>: An interface to memory-mapped files on both 
  Windows and Unix. A file's contents can be mapped directly into memory, at 
  which point it behaves like a mutable string, so its contents can be read and 
  modified. They can even be passed to functions that expect ordinary strings, 
  such as the <TT class=module>re</TT> module. (Contributed by Sam Rushing, with 
  some extensions by A.M. Kuchling.) 
  <P></P>
  <LI><TT class=module>pyexpat</TT>: An interface to the Expat XML parser. 
  (Contributed by Paul Prescod.) 
  <P></P>
  <LI><TT class=module>robotparser</TT>: Parse a <SPAN 
  class=file>robots.txt</SPAN> file, which is used for writing Web spiders that 
  politely avoid certain areas of a Web site. The parser accepts the contents of 
  a <SPAN class=file>robots.txt</SPAN> file, builds a set of rules from it, and 
  can then answer questions about the fetchability of a given URL. (Contributed 
  by Skip Montanaro.) 
  <P></P>
  <LI><TT class=module>tabnanny</TT>: A module/script to check Python source 
  code for ambiguous indentation. (Contributed by Tim Peters.) 
  <P></P>
  <LI><TT class=module>UserString</TT>: A base class useful for deriving objects 
  that behave like strings. 
  <P></P>
  <LI><TT class=module>webbrowser</TT>: A module that provides a platform 
  independent way to launch a web browser on a specific URL. For each platform, 
  various browsers are tried in a specific order. The user can alter which 
  browser is launched by setting the <VAR>BROWSER</VAR> environment variable. 
  (Originally inspired by Eric S. Raymond's patch to <TT 
  class=module>urllib</TT> which added similar functionality, but the final 
  module comes from code originally implemented by Fred Drake as <SPAN 
  class=file>Tools/idle/BrowserControl.py</SPAN>, and adapted for the standard 
  library by Fred.) 
  <P></P>
  <LI><TT class=module>_winreg</TT>: An interface to the Windows registry. <TT 
  class=module>_winreg</TT> is an adaptation of functions that have been part of 
  PythonWin since 1995, but has now been added to the core distribution, and 
  enhanced to support Unicode. <TT class=module>_winreg</TT> was written by Bill 
  Tutt and Mark Hammond. 
  <P></P>
  <LI><TT class=module>zipfile</TT>: A module for reading and writing ZIP-format 
  archives. These are archives produced by <B class=program>PKZIP</B> on 
  DOS/Windows or <B class=program>zip</B> on Unix, not to be confused with <B 
  class=program>gzip</B>-format files (which are supported by the <TT 
  class=module>gzip</TT> module) (Contributed by James C. Ahlstrom.) 
  <P></P>
  <LI><TT class=module>imputil</TT>: A module that provides a simpler way for 
  writing customised import hooks, in comparison to the existing <TT 
  class=module>ihooks</TT> module. (Implemented by Greg Stein, with much 
  discussion on python-dev along the way.)

<P>
<H1><A name=SECTION0001800000000000000000>17 Deleted and Deprecated Modules</A> 
</H1>
<P>A few modules have been dropped because they're obsolete, or because there 
are now better ways to do the same thing. The <TT class=module>stdwin</TT> 
module is gone; it was for a platform-independent windowing toolkit that's no 
longer developed. 
<P>A number of modules have been moved to the <SPAN class=file>lib-old</SPAN> 
subdirectory: <TT class=module>cmp</TT>, <TT class=module>cmpcache</TT>, <TT 
class=module>dircmp</TT>, <TT class=module>dump</TT>, <TT

class=module>packmail</TT>, <TT class=module>poly</TT>, <TT 
class=module>util</TT>, <TT class=module>whatsound</TT>, <TT 
class=module>zmod</TT>. If you have code which relies on a module that's been 
moved to <SPAN class=file>lib-old</SPAN>, you can simply add that directory to 
<CODE>sys.path</CODE> to get them back, but you're encouraged to update any code 
that uses these modules.
