This directory contains the full source distribution 
of Python version 2.0--both its packed archive file, 
and an unpacked version for easy viewing.  

The source distribution includes some tools not available
elsewhere (e.g., the "freeze" tool), and can be used to
build a Python interpreter from its source-code on most
platforms where a binary executable install is not 
available.  On Unix systems, for instance, run config
and make command lines to build and install Python (see
this source distribution's README file for details).
