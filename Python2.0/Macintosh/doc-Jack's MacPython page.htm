<H2>What is MacPython?</H2>MacPython is the port of Guido van Rossum's Python 
high-level object-oriented language to the Mac. Python is freely distributable 
and available in source form too. The motherlode of information on Python is the 
website, <A href="http://www.python.org/">http://www.python.org/</A>, and the 
ftp site, <A href="ftp://ftp.python.org/">ftp://ftp.python.org/</A>. There you 
will also find information on the Python newsgroup <A 
href="news:comp.lang.python">comp.lang.python</A> and the associated mailing 
list, the Python Software Activity, Python Special Interest Groups and much 
more. 
<P>The only Special Interest Group I will mention here is the <A 
href="http://www.python.org/sigs/pythonmac-sig/">PythonMac SIG</A>, which has 
discussions on Macintosh-specific aspects of Python. 
<P>Aside from the numerous extension modules available on most platforms 
(include the Tk windowing toolkit, sockets and many others) MacPython has a 
number of extension modules specifically for MacOS. MacPython programmers have 
access to QuickDraw, QuickTime, the Sound manager and various third party 
toolkits like Internet Config and Waste, to name but a few. 
<P>Also included is an integrated development environment by Just van Rossum, 
which includes an editor, debugger and class browser all closely integrated. 
<P>The full distributions below contain examples and some documentation on 
Mac-specific aspects of using Python. Documentation on the language and the 
standard library can be obtained at the <A href="http://www.python.org/">Python 
website.</A> As of the 2.0 distribution this is also the home for the 
documentation of the mac-specific modules. 
<P>
<HR>

<H2>Current distribution</H2>The current stable distribution is 2.0. As of 2.0 
MacPython is distributed as a PPC-only application, 68k users should get release 
1.5.2 from the <A href="http://www.cwi.nl/ftp/jack/python/mac/old">old 
distributions</A> section. It can optionally install NumPy (libraries for 
numeric calculations), Tkinter (for platform-independent GUI-building), PIL (for 
imaging) and img (another package for imaging) and the developer addon, files 
needed for creating your own C extension modules for Python with CodeWarrior. 
<P>The installer is available in <A 
href="http://www.cwi.nl/ftp/jack/python/mac/MacPython20.bin">MacBinary 
format</A> (about 7Mb) and <A 
href="http://www.cwi.nl/ftp/jack/python/mac/MacPython20.hqx">BinHex format</A> 
(about 9Mb). Use the latter installer if your browser mistreats MacBinary files 
(as many appear to do). 
<P>If you need to download with FTP in stead of HTTP go to <A 
href="ftp://ftp.cwi.nl/pub/jack/python/mac">ftp://ftp.cwi.nl/pub/jack/python/mac</A>. 

<P><EM>Note:</EM>When running the installer the "finishing installation" dialog 
will be shown for a long time, especially on slower systems. The installer is 
now telling the finder about icon positions for each individual file (sigh). 
Apparently you can abort this with little ill effect. 
<P><EM>Note 2:</EM> some problems have been reported reported when installing 
MacPython on iMacs if you have the Virex antivirus software running. Disabling 
Virex should help here. 
<P>
<H2>Documentation</H2>You need the standard Python documentation (tutorial, 
reference manual, library reference) available at <A 
href="http://www.python.org/">http://www.python.org/</A>. In addition you need 
the Mac addendum to the library reference, also available there. 
<P>Tambien, si puede leer espanol, <A href="http://www.idg.es/macworld">MacWorld 
Espana</A> tiene un curso de programacion en Python sobre el Mac. Esta seria 
comenza en el numero de julio/agosto 1998. 
<P>And if you don't read spanish you can safely ignore the paragraph above:-) 
<P>
<H2>Source distributions</H2>A MacPython 2.0 source distribution is also 
available, at <A 
href="http://www.cwi.nl/ftp/jack/python/mac/MacPython20src.sit">ftp://ftp.cwi.nl/pub/jack/python/mac/MacPython20src.sit</A>. 
This distribution needs a specialised version of GUSI 2.1.1, which is available 
as <A 
href="http://www.cwi.nl/ftp/jack/python/mac/GUSI211-for-MacPython.sit">ftp://ftp.cwi.nl/pub/jack/python/mac/GUSI211-for-MacPython.sit</A>. 

<P>The source distribution has built with CodeWarrior Pro 5.3, but it should 
work fine with CW Pro 6 (after converting the projects). However, for CW Pro 6 
you will need GUSI 2.1.3, for which a specialised verion is available at <A 
href="http://www.cwi.nl/ftp/jack/python/mac/GUSI213-for-MacPython.sit">ftp://ftp.cwi.nl/pub/jack/python/mac/GUSI213-for-MacPython.sit</A>. 

<P>It is, however, strongly suggested that if you want to contribute actively to 
MacPython development you get source access through the public CVS repository 
(see below), as this will ensure that you are always working with the most 
recent version of the sources. 
<P>
<H2>Miscellaneous</H2><A name=ftpprobs>The installers</A> live in <A 
href="ftp://ftp.cwi.nl/pub/jack/python/mac">ftp://ftp.cwi.nl/pub/jack/python/mac</A>, 
by the way. Our ftp-server is rather picky about IP-addresses (reverse name 
lookup should work), if you have trouble accessing any of the links here you can 
also get at the files via the http-server, at url <A 
href="http://www.cwi.nl/ftp/jack/python/mac/">http://www.cwi.nl/ftp/jack/python/mac/</A>. 

<P>As Corran Webster, cwebster@nevada.edu, reported recently it is not necessary 
to buy the CodeWarrior C compiler to write MacPython extension modules: in many 
case Apple's free MPW tools work just fine. See his <A 
href="http://www.nevada.edu/~cwebster/Python/MPWHOWTO/MPWHOWTO.html">Compiling 
Python modules with MPW</A> page for details. 
<P>
<H2>CVS Source access</H2><EM>Note:</EM>the information in this section is for 
people who have read the <CODE>building.html</CODE> document in the source 
distribution and decide they want CVS access. You are not expected to understand 
it (or be interested in it) if you haven't read that document. 
<P>The MacPython sources are also accessible through remote CVS, at 
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>CVSROOT: 
  ropython@pythoncvs.oratrix.nl:/hosts/mm/CVSREMOTE<BR>Password: 
  geheim<BR>Authentication: pserver<BR>Module: python/Mac </CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>As 
stated in the building.html document: please use MacCVS from <A 
href="http://www.wincvs.org/">http://www.wincvs.org/</A>, <EM>not</EM> MacCVS 
Pro, which does not appear to work with the Python CVS archives. 
<P>If you start using the CVS archive please send me a mail at <A 
href="mailto:jack@cwi.nl">jack@cwi.nl</A> so I have some idea of how many people 
use it. It is also suggested that you subscribe to the <A 
href="http://www.oratrix.nl/mailman/listinfo/pythonmac-checkins">MacPython CVS 
checkin mailing list</A>. 
<P>The CVS repository for the libraries used by MacPython is currently in a 
flux, it is suggested you just download these in source form, as explained in 
<CODE>building.html</CODE>. </P>
<H2>MacOS X</H2>For MacOS X Server you are probably better off with the Unix 
distribution of Python, get it through <A href="http://www.python.org/">the 
Python website</A>. It is reported to run out of the box, with only some modules 
(like Tkinter) not working. 
<P>And, if you don't have the developer option for MacOS X, Tony Lownds has 
compiled everything and packaged it. Check his <A 
href="http://tony.lownds.com/macosx/">MacOS X Python page</A>. 
<P>
<H2>Older distributions</H2>Older distributions are still available in <A 
href="ftp://ftp.cwi.nl/pub/jack/python/mac">ftp://ftp.cwi.nl/pub/jack/python/mac</A>. 

<P>
<H2>Alternative locations</H2>If for some reason you cannot download stuff from 
here try at the general Python site, <A 
href="http://www.python.org/">http://www.python.org/</A>. Everything should be 
available there too. 
<P>
<H2>JPython</H2>Another way to run Python programs on your Macintosh is to use 
JPython, the Python interpreter written in Java. Here is what Bill Dozier, 
dozier@abs.net, had to say on the subject for Python 1.5. Please let me know 
whether this information is still up-to-date if you try it. 
<BLOCKQUOTE>Using JPython now is really very easy. To install, just drop 
  JPython1.1beta4.class onto the JBindery icon (you need the MRJ SDK to do 
  this). They now have it set up so that you can just take the defaults to get 
  InstallAnywhere going. Unfortunately, the save dialog that pops up to ask for 
  the installation location is a little wierd. First of all, it defaults to your 
  Preferences folder. Next, you have to tell it to "open" a file (any file) in 
  the directory where you want JPython installed. 
  <P>Once you have JPython installed, you will want to make a JBindery app to 
  have double-clickable file for starting the interpreter. Drop the jpython.jar 
  file (from your chosen install directory) onto JBindery. Choose 
  "org.python.core.jpython" for the "Class name" in the first panel. Set both 
  stdin and stdout to be "message window." Click on "Classpath" and make sure 
  jpython.jar is there. If not, you can either drag it in or use the "add .zip 
  file" button to add it to the list. Click on "save settings...", choose "save 
  as application" and you will have an icon that you can double-click to start 
  the JPython interpreter. 
  <P>To run a script, drop the JPython app you made from the instructions in the 
  previous paragraph onto JBindery. Put the name of the file that you want to 
  run in the "optional parameters" list and make sure that the folder containing 
  your ".py" file is in the classpath (you can just drag your script file onto 
  the list to get it there). Do the "save as application" again and you have a 
  double-clickable icon that will run your script. I do this and then cycle 
  through editing the script with the IDE or CodeWarrior or Alpha and 
  double-clicking this icon to test my code. </P></BLOCKQUOTE>
