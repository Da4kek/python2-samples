This directory contains the Windows self-installer
program for Python release 2.0 (the latest version 
at this book's publication).  The Python installer
automatically installs the full Python interpreter 
and standard libraries, as well as support for the 
Tkinter GUI library, DBM files, and more.

Simply run or click on the file name in this directory
to install Python; in most cases, you'll want to answer
"yes" or "ok" to any questions asked during the install,
to perform a default install.  In this release, Tk files
are installed in Python's own install directory.

After the install, see the Python menu in the "Programs"
selection available in your "Start" button.  It includes
entries for:

- starting a Python interactive session
- starting the IDLE development GUI
- opening Python's standard manuals in your web browser
- uninstalling (removing) the Python package

After the install, you can also launch Python scripts by
clicking on their filenames in a Windows file explorer 
GUI, or by typing command lines in a DOS console window.

For instance, you should be able to click on the Launch_*.py
scripts at the top-level of the CD's Examples\PP2E directory
to start major book examples, as soon as the Python install 
finishes.

- The CD's top-level WindowsExt directory, for the WIidows
  tools extensions package. Install this after installing 
  Python itself, if you wish to use Windows-specific 
  tools like COM.

- The CD's Python1.5.2 directory, for a self-installer for
  the prior Python release.  Use this only if you run into 
  bugs or incompatibilities in Python2.0.

  to appear after this book's publication.
