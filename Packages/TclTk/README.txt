The underlying library used for the Python Tkinter GUI
API.  Note that in most cases you do not need the files
here at all:

- The Python Windows self-installer automatically
  installs Tcl/Tk 8.3 with Python 2.0 (and Tcl/Tk 8.0 
  is installed along with Python 1.5.2), so you do not 
  need to install Tcl/Tk yourself on Windows.  

- Tkinter is also a standard part of the Python standard 
  library on all platforms, and need not be installed 
  individually.

The files here may still be useful on some platforms 
if your Python does not come with bundled Tk support.
