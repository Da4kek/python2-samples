This directory contains the IDLE integrated development
environment for Python--both tgz and zip archives, as 
well as documentation written by Daryl Harms.

Note: you most likely do not need to use the packages 
here on your machine:

- Python's self-install .exe for Windows automatically 
  installs IDLE on your machine, along with Python and 
  Python manuals; after the install, IDLE is available 
  as an entry in your Start button's Program/Python menu.

- IDLE is also included in the Tools directory of the 
  full Python source distribution.
