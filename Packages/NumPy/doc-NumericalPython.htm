<H2>MiniFAQ</H2>
<H3>Why Numerical Python?</H3>If x and y are Numerical Python arrays, then the 
speed of the operation x + y is close to the speed of doing it in C if the 
arrays are big enough. Thus, Python can be extended with a full scientific array 
language with sophisticated indexing and shaping operations and yet be closer to 
the speed of a compiled language than to the speed of Python itself. 
<H3>Assignment doesn't make a copy?</H3>
<P>Right. The statement y=x just creates a new name for the same array object. 
While consistent with Python, this is upsetting to users of other array 
languages. Likewise, x[i:j] is not a copy. Please read the manual. </P>
<H3>I get an error message about n32 / o32 on SGI </H3>
<P>A numpy user who ran into this consulted Martin von Loewe. The user said, "It 
is indeed an SGI thing, two different (perhaps n/o for new/old) binary formats 
for files, libraries, etc; both formats are supported by IRIX64. The KEY hint 
from Martin von Loewe (for installing Python2.0) was that usually all libraries 
are installed in both versions, so all I had to do was to find "siblings" of 
those libs that did not work, and link them to the names that python expected. " 
</P>
<H3>What about dealing with missing observations? </H3>
<P>An optional package "MA", distributed with Numpy and documented in the 
manual, is designed to be a drop-in replacement for Numeric, allowing you to do 
operations and function calls without involving array entries that are invalid, 
including sums, averages, division, etc. </P>
<H3>How do I become a "developer"?</H3>Write to one of the current developers 
and describe your experience and interests. The current developers act as a 
committee of equal peers and will discuss your request. Paul Dubois (dubois at 
users.sourceforge.net) serves as the chairperson of this group and has veto 
power over requests for enhancements. 
<P>There are different communities of users with different goals and 
aspirations. To keep Numerical as useful as possible to as many people as 
possible, we are taking a conservative approach to growth, applying Bertrand 
Meyer's famous hope for Eiffel that it would "grow no faster than the rate of 
inflation."
