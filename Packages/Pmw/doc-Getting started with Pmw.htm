  <H2>Introduction</H2>
  <DD>
  <P>This document describes how to fetch and install Pmw, and how to run the 
  demonstrations and tests. </P>
  <DT>
  <H2>Requirements</H2>
  <DD>
  <P>Pmw.0.8.4 requires the _tkinter and Tkinter modules. It works with python 
  1.5.2 and Tk 8.0. </P>
  <P>If the BLT extension to Tk is present, Pmw will use the BLT busy command 
  during modal dialogs to display a clock cursor. Also, the Pmw.Blt interface to 
  the BLT busy, graph, stripchart, tabset and vector commands will be available. 
  Only BLT version 2.4i is supported. You can find BLT at <A 
  href="http://www.tcltk.com/blt/">http://www.tcltk.com/blt/</A>. </P>
  <DT>
  <H2>Distribution and installation</H2>
  <DD>
  <P>Releases of the Pmw distribution are available via ftp from 
  <CODE>ftp.dscpl.com.au</CODE>. This release is available at <A 
  href="ftp://ftp.dscpl.com.au/pub/pmw/Pmw.0.8.4.tar.gz"><CODE>pub/pmw/Pmw.0.8.4.tar.gz</CODE></A>, 
  released on 12 May 2000. This is a compressed tar file which, under Unix, can 
  be unpacked like this: 
  <DL>
    <DD><PRE>gunzip Pmw.0.8.4.tar.gz
tar xvf Pmw.0.8.4.tar
</PRE></DD></DL>
  <P></P>
  <P>Under Microsoft Windows, you will need a program such as WinZip (<A 
  href="http://www.winzip.com/">http://www.winzip.com/</A>) that can unpack the 
  gzipped tar files. You may need to change the suffix of the file to 
  <STRONG>.tgz</STRONG> for WinZip to recognise it. </P>
  <P>This will unpack into a directory named Pmw. You now need to put this 
  directory somewhere python can find it, preferably in one of the standard 
  places, such as in the <CODE>site-packages</CODE> directory (eg: 
  <CODE>/usr/local/lib/python1.5/site-packages/Pmw</CODE>) or the 
  <CODE>sys.prefix</CODE> directory (eg: <CODE>C:\Program 
  Files\Python\Pmw</CODE> or <CODE>/usr/local/lib/python1.5</CODE>). </P>
  <P>If you do not have access to these standard directories, place the Pmw 
  directory somewhere on your <CODE>PYTHONPATH</CODE> or <CODE>sys.path</CODE>. 
  If this is not possible, place the Pmw directory somewhere else and add the 
  parent directory to your <CODE>PYTHONPATH</CODE> or <CODE>sys.path</CODE>. 
</P>
  <P>If you have previously installed Pmw version 0.6 or later, then the new 
  version can share the same <CODE>Pmw</CODE> directory as the previous 
  versions. You will need to perform the <CODE>tar</CODE> extraction in the 
  directory containing (that is, the parent directory of) the existing 
  <CODE>Pmw</CODE> directory. By default, your applications will use the most 
  recent version of Pmw. If required, the function <CODE>Pmw.setversion()</CODE> 
  can be used to specify a version to be used. See the reference manual for 
  details. If you are no longer using the older versions, you can safely remove 
  the corresponding subdirectories from the <CODE>Pmw</CODE> directory. </P>
  <DT>
  <H2>Documentation</H2>
  <DD>
  <P>The <CODE>doc</CODE> directory for each Pmw version contains all the 
  documentation for that version of Pmw. See the local <A 
  href="http://www.dscpl.com.au/pmw/doc/index.html">home page</A> for a complete 
  list of documents. The files in this directory are also available from the <A 
  href="http://www.dscpl.com.au/pmw/">official Pmw home page</A>. </P>
  <DT>
  <H2>Demonstrations and tests</H2>
  <DD>
  <P>A good way to get an overview of the functionality provided by Pmw is to 
  run the demonstrations and tests and look at the demonstration code. To view a 
  comprehensive demonstration of many of the features of Pmw run the 
  <CODE>All.py</CODE> script, which can be found in the <CODE>demos</CODE> 
  subdirectory of each version of Pmw. 
  <P>You do not have to install Pmw to run the demonstrations and tests, simply 
  change into the appropriate directory and run the file <CODE>All.py</CODE>. 
  See <A 
  href="http://www.dscpl.com.au/pmw/doc/demosandtests.html">Demonstrations and 
  tests</A> for more information about running the demonstrations and tests and 
  how to create your own. </P><A name=contributions></A>
  <DT>
  <H2>Contributions welcome</H2>
  <DD>
  <P>If you create some whiz-bang megawidgets and would like to contribute them 
  to Pmw, they will be most welcome. You should be able to get some idea of the 
  coding style used in Pmw code by reading <A 
  href="http://www.dscpl.com.au/pmw/doc/howtobuild.html">How to build Pmw 
  megawidgets</A> and by looking at the Pmw library code itself in the 
  <CODE>lib</CODE> directory of each Pmw version. </P>
  <P>If you would like to contribute a megawidget, it would be preferable if it 
  also came with a simple demonstration and a test script. See <A 
  href="http://www.dscpl.com.au/pmw/doc/demosandtests.html">Demonstrations and 
  tests</A> for information about how to create new demonstrations and tests. 
  <P>Each megawidget should also have a reference manual describing its options, 
  components and methods. </P><A name=docgen></A>
  <DT>
  <H2>Generating the documentation</H2>
  <DD>
  <P>The released reference manuals are automatically generated by merging 
  specially marked-up text with the output from megawidget query methods, such 
  as <CODE>components()</CODE>, <CODE>options()</CODE> and 
  <CODE>componentaliases()</CODE>, and various other introspective devices. If 
  you are interested to see how the documentation is generated, you can fetch 
  the marked-up text and the python script to convert the text to html from <A 
  href="ftp://ftp.dscpl.com.au/pub/pmw/Pmw.0.8.4.docsrc.tar.gz"><CODE>pub/pmw/Pmw.0.8.4.docsrc.tar.gz</CODE></A>. 
  Download this file into the <CODE>Pmw/Pmw_0_8_4</CODE> directory of the Pmw 
  source tree. Unzip and untar the file. This will create a <CODE>docsrc</CODE> 
  sub-directory of <CODE>Pmw/Pmw_0_8_4</CODE>. If you want to keep the 
  documentation which came with the Pmw distribution, rename the old 
  <CODE>doc</CODE> directory. Then change directory to <CODE>docsrc</CODE> and 
  run <CODE>createmanuals.py</CODE>. After printing lots of warnings about 
  documentation that has not been written yet, this will create a new 
  <CODE>doc</CODE> directory containing all the html documentation. 
  <P>Here is an example set of commands to unpack the documentation source and 
  regenerate the documentation, assuming you have downloaded the source in the 
  Pmw/Pmw_0_8_4 directory: 
  <DL>
    <DD><PRE>cd Pmw/Pmw_0_8_4
gunzip Pmw.0.8.4.docsrc.tar.gz
tar xvf Pmw.0.8.4.docsrc.tar
mv doc doc.old
cd docsrc
./createmanuals.py
</PRE></DD></DL>
  <P></P>
  <P>If running under Unix, you will need to run the 
  <CODE>createmanuals.py</CODE> script with a valid DISPLAY environment 
  variable, since it creates each megawidget and then queries it for its 
  options, components, etc. This is because Tk (and hence Tkinter) requires a 
  connection to an X server to run. </P>
  <DT>
  <H2>Future plans and bugs</H2>
  <DD>
  <P>The <A href="http://www.dscpl.com.au/pmw/doc/todo.html">todo list</A> 
  contains a long list of of suggestions, bugs and enhancements for Pmw. If you 
  are interested in doing any of these, please let me (<A 
  href="mailto:gregm@iname.com"><I>gregm@iname.com</I></A>) know. Some of the 
  items in the todo list may be considered bugs. There are also some other 
  problems due to idiosyncrasies in the implementation of Tk. </P>
  <DT>
  <H2>Acknowledgements</H2>
  <DD>
  <P>The initial ideas for Pmw were blatantly stolen from the itcl extensions <A 
  href="http://www.tcltk.com/itk">[incr Tk]</A> by Michael McLennan and <A 
  href="http://www.tcltk.com/iwidgets">[incr Widgets]</A> by Mark Ulferts. 
  Several of the megawidgets are direct translations from the itcl to python. 
  </P>
  <P>The base classes and most megawidgets were written by Greg McFarlane and 
  Peter Munnings. Contributed megawidgets include: Pmw.TimeCounter by Joe 
  VanAndel, Pmw.Group and an early version of Pmw.NoteBook by Case Roole, 
  Pmw.ScrolledCanvas, Pmw.ScrolledFrame and another early version of 
  Pmw.NoteBook by Joe Saltiel and Pmw.OptionMenu by Roman Sulzhyk. A big thank 
  you to the following people for their bug reports, fixes, enhancements and 
  suggestions: David Ascher, Robin Becker, Siggy Brentrup, Mark Colclough, 
  Jerome Gay, Clemens Hintze, Rob Hooft Jack Jansen, Jonathan Kelly, Magnus 
  Kessler, Matthias Klose, Andreas Kostyrka, Fredrik Lundh, Magnus Lycka, Graham 
  Matthews, Dieter Maurer, Michael McLay, Daniel Michelson, Georg Mischler, Rob 
  Pearson, Case Roole, Joe Saltiel, Roman Sulzhyk, Shen Wang, Chris Wright, and 
  Guido van Rossum. Special thanks to Case Roole and Michael McLay for help with 
  getting Pmw to work with python 1.5 packages and many other nifty features. My 
  deepest apologies if I have forgotten anyone. Please let me know. </P>
