The OpenSSL package provides secure sockets support.
Python 2.0's socket module supports this package (as
an option), for developing secure server side Python
applications on the web.

To fetch OpenSSL, please visit www.openssl.org, and 
follow the download instructions there.  This site
listed some legal precautions related to distribution
of encryption software that were ambiguous enough to 
preclude its inclusion on this CD.
