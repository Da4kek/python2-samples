Note: the package here, win32all, only contains 
extensions for Python, not Python itself. Install
ythe appropriate win32all package after you've 
installed the standard Python package.

win32all contains Windows-specific tools such as
COM support, the PythonWin IDE, and so on.  To make
use of these, first install Python itself--run one
of the Python .exe self-installer files elsewhere
on this CD before trying to install win32all (e.g., 
run Python1.5.2\WindowsInstall\py152.exe to install
Python1.5.2 plus Tkinter for Windows first).

The Python installer installs Python with Tkinter
support by itself.  Note that Tkinter programs won't
currently run under the PythonWin IDE; use IDLE or
the python.exe or pythonw.exe programs directly
instead.
