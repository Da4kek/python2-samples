This directory contains a release of HTMLgen, the HTML
(web page) generator written in Python, for use in Python
scripts.  Python programs build object trees that 'know'
how to emit correct HTML to display themselves in a web
browser.  See the Advanced Internet Topics chapter for 
details and usage.
