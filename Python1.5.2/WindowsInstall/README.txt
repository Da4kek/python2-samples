This is a self-installing, complete Python system for
Windows with bundled Tkinter and DBM support.  It runs on 
Windows 95, 98, 2000, and NT (and probably later systems
as well).

Run (or double-click) file py152.exe to install Python1.5.2
for Windows, with built-in Tkinter support.  In most cases,
you'll want a standard, default install--answer "yes", "ok",
or "next" to every prompt during the install, and be sure to
say "yes" when asked if you want to install Tcl/Tk for Tkinter
as well.  

When the install is done, a Python entry shows up in your
Start button's Programs group, and Python program files can 
be launched by clicking on them in file explorer.  The Start
button entry also has entries for the IDLE integrated 
development GUI, and Python standard manuals (they open in
your local web browser when selected).

Also see: 

- The CD's WindowsExt directory, for an add-on package of 
  Windows-specific extensions to Python (but install Python
  here first, before the Windows extensions).

- The CD's Python2.0 directory, for a self-installer for
  the very latest Python release, 2.0.  In most cases, you
  will probably want to install 2.0 instead of the 1.5.2 
  package here.   The 1.5.2 package here is included mostly
  as a fallback, in case of bugs or incompatibilities in 
  the 2.0 release (it was new as this book was published).
  Python2.0 installs Tk support files in its own directory.
