<h2><a name="1.1">1.1. How do I configure the web server to run my
scripts?</a></h2>

You have two choices for running your Python scripts- either you can configure
the server to run them ONLY from the cgi-bin directory, or you can set the
server to run them from ANY location. There are definitely reasons for
choosing either configuration, but I'll leave it at that for now. These
instructions are specifically for the Apache 1.1.bx server.
<p>
A) If you want them to ONLY be run from the cgi-bin directory, change the line
in access.conf from:</p>
<p>
&lt;Directory /usr/local/etc/httpd/cgi-bin> Options Indexes FollowSymLinks
&lt;/Directory></p>
<p>
to:</p>
<p>
&lt;Directory /usr/local/etc/httpd/cgi-bin> Options FollowSymLinks ExecCGI
&lt;/Directory> (substituting the REAL path to your cgi-bin directory
here)</p>
<p>
B) If you want scripts to be run from any location in the html tree, comment
out the above section from the access.conf file and put in a section that
looks like:</p>
<p>
&lt;Directory /usr/local/etc/httpd/htdocs> Options All &lt;/Directory></p>
<p>
(again, replacing the path with your document root path)</p>
<p>
Also, add the line:</p>
<p>
AddHandler cgi-script .py</p>
<p>
to your srm.conf file.</p>
<p>
Finally, make sure your script has the world-executable and world-readable
bits set! To do this, do a chmod ugo+rx myfile.py.</p>

<h2><a name="1.2">1.2. How do I debug my scripts?</a></h2>

I personally use two main methods -
<p>
Do a "tail -f" on the file logs/error_log. This gives you a
continuously-updated view of your error log, which is where all the output
from your calls to sys.stderr.write() goes.</p>
<p>
Try to run your script from the shell-prompt. Many times it is easier to find
the location of a syntax error by running the script directly, as opposed to
trying to find it from the error log. You may need to set several CGI
environment variables in order for your script to run as far as the error.
Your program should have the above</p>
<p>
</p>
<pre> if (__name__ == "__main__"): 
   main()</pre>

bit of code in it, so that you can import your module and test it
interactively. Oftentimes trying to run your script manually will expose
errors like your script trying to import a module that isn't in the scripts
library path.
<p>
If your script uses the cgi.FieldStorage class for form input, you'll need to
set the environment variables REQUEST_METHOD and QUERY_STRING appropriately
before running your script from the command line. Otherwise your script will
appear to hang if you try to run it interactively, but when you hit control-c,
it will give something like the following traceback:</p>
<p>
</p>
<pre> Traceback (innermost last):
   File "./letter.py", line 93, in ?
     main()
   File "./letter.py", line 23, in main
     form = cgi.FieldStorage()
   File "/usr/local/lib/python1.4/cgi.py", line 822, in __init__
     self.read_single()
   File "/usr/local/lib/python1.4/cgi.py", line 901, in read_single
     self.read_lines()
   File "/usr/local/lib/python1.4/cgi.py", line 925, in read_lines
     self.read_lines_to_eof()
   File "/usr/local/lib/python1.4/cgi.py", line 930, in read_lines_to_eof
     line = self.fp.readline()
 KeyboardInterrupt</pre>

For example, if your script is expecting a form called "page" to be submitted,
and you want it set to "info", set the environment like this:
<p>
</p>
<pre>  setenv REQUEST_METHOD "GET"
  setenv QUERY_STRING "page=info"</pre>

This is of course under unix only. (sorry!)
<p>
See also question 2.4 for what to do if you don't even get this far...</p>

<h2><a name="1.3">1.3. Using Python for CGI on Microsoft Windows</a></h2>

[Due to Aaron Watters] On the Microsoft IIS server or on the Win95 MS Personal
Web Server you set up python in the same way that you would set up any other
scripting engine.
<p>
Run regedt32 and go to:</p>
<p>
</p>
<pre>  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\W3SVC\Parameters\ScriptMap </pre>

and enter the following line (making any specific changes that your system may
need)
<p>
</p>
<pre>  .py :REG_SZ: c:\&lt;path to python>\python.exe -u %s %s </pre>

This line will allow you to call your script with a simple reference like:
http://yourserver/scripts/yourscript.py provided "scripts" is an "executable"
directory for your server (which it usually is by default). The "-u" flag
specifies unbuffered and binary mode for stdin - needed when working with
binary data
<p>
In addition, it is recommended by people who would know that using ".py" may
not be a good idea for the file extensions when used in this context (you
might want to reserve *.py for support modules and use *.cgi or *.cgp for
"main program" scripts). However, that issue is beyond this Windows FAQ
entry.</p>
<p>
Netscape Servers: Information on this topic exists at: <a
href="http://home.netscape.com/comprod/server_central/support/fasttrack_man/programs.htm#1010870">http://home.netscape.com/comprod/server_central/support/fasttrack_man/programs.htm#1010870</a></p>

[addendum contributed by Carl Feynmann]</p>
<p>
If you are using the Personal Web Server under Windows 95, you may be using a
version that does not support running CGI scripts. There are actually two
versions of Personal Web Server: the Front Page Personal Web Server, and the
Microsoft Personal Web Server. The former will not run files from the
'scripts' directory; it fails with an obscure message about the directory
being unreadable. You can tell whether you are running the good version of the
server by looking in the task bar, in the little tray next to the clock. If it
contains an icon that says 'Personal Web Server' when you slide the mouse over
it, you have the good one.</p>
<p>
There are two ways you might have gotten the bad server: either you installed
version 1.1 or earlier of Front Page, or, when installing, you did not check
the boxes in the installer for 'Server Extensions'. The first case can
supposedly be fixed by getting a Front Page 98 CD-ROM and looking in the
directory \PWS\UPGRADE for lengthly directions. I have verified the directions
were there, but haven't tried following them. The second case can be fixed by
reinstalling Front Page 98, choosing a custom installation, and checking the
boxes for 'Server Extensions Resource Kit' and 'Server Extensions
Administration Pages'.</p>

<h2><a name="1.5">1.5. Can I write Netscape WAI apps in Python?</a></h2>

Yes! Try the Netscape WAI module for Python, which you can get from python.org
at <a
href="http://www.python.org/ftp/python/contrib/Web/waimodule-0.1.tar.gz">http://www.python.org/ftp/python/contrib/Web/waimodule-0.1.tar.gz</a>
<p>
WAI is Netscape's hopeful successor to their NSAPI server extension mechanism.
It allows server apps to be run either internally or externally to the server
process, and to be either started manually or automatically by the server when
needed.</p>
<p>
Two cool features about WAI apps are:</p>
<pre>  1- apps can be run on separate machines from the web server</pre>

(subject to security concerns of course. netscape doesn't recommend this
unless you've thought it out well). I used this feature to run "snoop" apps on
SGI Indys around Magnet so I could look out each of four different cameras
located on those boxes, all through urls on the same web server.
<p>
</p>
<pre>  2- through the "osagent" tool, multiple apps can be started,</pre>

supporting app redundancy. If one goes down, requests will be automatically
rerouted to another instance. I haven't personally tried this, but I assume
you'd assume responsibility in your code for making sure the state between all
running apps is consistent.
<p>
Netscape has included C, C++, and Java bindings with Enterprise-3.0. The
Python WAI interface provides a binding nearly identical to the Java one,
implemented in C. Unfortunately, i've not been able to compile a functional
shared module version of this, so the included Makefile gives you a new python
interpreter with a statically bound version of the module. If someone manages
to get a shared version working I would be very grateful to hear about it!</p>
<p>
The basic idea behind writing a WAI app is you subclass from
wai.WebApplicationInterface, and provide a Run() method in your class. This
method is called for each incoming web request, and receives a
HTTPServiceRequest object, containing the various request information, such as
headers and cgi variables. A WAIFieldStorage object is provided in the
waicgi.py module which can parse submitted form information into a real
cgi.FieldStorage object which you can handle in the same old cgi fashion.</p>
<p>
Thus, converting a cgi program to a (much much faster) WAI application is
usually just a matter of moving initialization calls into your app class's
__init__() method, and calling your old main() method from the app class's
Run() method after creating the new WAIFieldStorage object.</p>
<p>
So far unfortunately i've had trouble in trying to change the WAI app's http
result code to anything but 200. If I set it to anything else, via the
HTTPServiceRequest.setResponseStatus() method, the server goes haywire,
starting new wai processes for EACH request, until a dozen or so appear, at
which time the server basically quits responding. I looked into the problem,
but didn't solve anything. A test program using the C interface worked
properly, yet the Python one did not.. :( Again, if anyone gets this to work
properly, I would appreciate hearing about it!</p>

<h2><a name="1.6">1.6. What's this Bobo thing i've heard about?</a></h2>

(stolen from a post to the python list)
<p>
Bobo has been incorporated into Zope, available on this CDROM. See
Applications/Zope for both the</p>
<p>
Windows95/NT and Unix versions. </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
We now return you to the FAQ entry:</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
> Has anyone got any experience of using Bobo or Persistant CGI from > Digital
Creations (<a href="http://www.digicool.com">http://www.digicool.com</a>). Any
thoughts? - danny.</p>
<p>
I have been using Bobo for over a year for commercial projects and I can
safely say that it has changed my life ;-) Bobo is simple and powerful and
provides a brilliant antidote to clumsy, convoluted, and brittle CGI
programming. Bobo allows you to focus on object-oriented programming without
worrying much about the details of CGI plumbing.</p>
<p>
If you've ever written a CGI program in python that's more than 25 lines of
code, you owe it to yourself to check out Bobo. A great place to start is the
Introduction to Bobo written for Ken McDonald's forthcoming Quick Python Book
from Manning Publications. (<a
href="http://www.digicool.com/releases/bobo/intro">http://www.digicool.com/releases/bobo/intro</a>/)</p>
<p>
After that, take a look at Jim Fulton's tutorial (<a
href="http://www.digicool.com/releases/bobo/Tutorial">http://www.digicool.com/releases/bobo/Tutorial</a>/).
An important thing to remember as you start exploring Bobo is that it is
actually an ORB, not a CGI program framework.</p>
<p>
Bobo starts simple, but you can get pretty complex if you want, especially if
you choose to use DocumentTemplate (a very complete facility for generating
HTML), BoboPOS (a flexible object store), or long running processes.</p>
<p>
That said, there are a few gotchas that are pretty well documented, but should
be pointed out. Apache has a little trouble with Bobo's authentication scheme,
this is fixed in apache 1.3, but requires a patch for earlier versions (you
don't need the patch if you don't want to do authentication). The patch can be
found at <a
href="ftp://ftp.digicool.com/pub/releases/ServerPatches">ftp://ftp.digicool.com/pub/releases/ServerPatches</a>/
Also, Bobo requires a small bit of tweaking to work with windows since Bobo
normally uses symbolic links. However there are a couple simple solutions to
this problem. (<a
href="http://www.digicool.com/releases/bobo/Win32">http://www.digicool.com/releases/bobo/Win32</a>/)</p>
<p>
A good source of timely information on Bobo is the Bobo mailing list which is
archived by findmail (<a

<h2><a name="1.7">1.7. Can I write Python CGI scripts for
Apache/Win32?</a></h2>

Yes, a short description is available at:

</p>
<pre>  <a href="http://starship.skyport.net/crew/jbauer/apachenotes">http://starship.skyport.net/crew/jbauer/apachenotes</a>/</pre>

Of utmost importance is to make certain that you're using Python in unbuffered
mode (SetEnv PYTHONUNBUFFERED 1) and to set (or pass) PYTHONPATH as a system
environment variable. Forgetting to set either of these parameters is the most
common reason for "premature end of header" errors.

<h2><a name="1.8">1.8. How to run .pyc files as CGI</a></h2>

I configured my local Apache server to run ".pyc" files as CGI scripts. This
is quite handy, since you don't need to make .py files executable. They are
simply files which don't run.
<p>
The runnable version is the ".pyc" file.</p>
<p>
Advantages: You are forced to compile your .py file before with something like
...: python -c "import mymodule" and the code in the .pyc is at least
guaranteed syntactically ok. Execution speed might be a bit better when you
have large main scripts. It becomes easier to have readable and executable
files in the same directory.</p>
<p>
Furthermore you can extend the script below to do various additional checks
before running the actual script.</p>
<p>
Modifications for Apache:</p>
<p>
</p>
<pre> 1) In /httpd/conf/mime.types, insert a line which reads</pre>
<pre> application/x-python-compiled  pyc</pre>
<pre> 2) In /httpd/conf/srm.conf, insert a line like this:</pre>
<pre> Action application/x-python-compiled /cgi-bin/pyc_exec</pre>

This tells to start the script "pyc_exec" always when a .pyc file is
requested. This script could be a shell script which calls Python with the
.pyc as command line parameter, but I found it nicer and more efficient to
load the .pyc from a Python script. As the default action when the script
should give an error, I print out all the environment variables. Perhaps this
should be enhanced to print a traceback as well. Comments are welcome.
<p>
Here is the "pyc_exec" python script which goes into cgi-bin:</p>
<p>
</p>
<pre> ------------------------------------------------------------
 #! /usr/local/bin/python</pre>
<pre> import os, imp
 try :
        _script_ = "no script given"
        _script_ = os.environ["PATH_TRANSLATED"]
        try :
                _mode_ = "rb"
                _file_ = open(_script_, _mode_)
                imp.load_module("__main__", _file_, _script_, \
                        ("pyc", _mode_, imp.PY_COMPILED) )
        finally :
                _file_.close()
 except :
        print "Content-type: text/html\n"
        print "&lt;html>&lt;title>Error encountered during Script execution&lt;/title>"
        print "&lt;body>"
        print "&lt;H2>Script = '%s'&lt;/H2>" % _script_
        print "&lt;pre>"
        for name, value in os.environ.items():
                print "%s\t= %s" % (name, value)
        print "&lt;/pre>&lt;/body>&lt;/html>"
 ------------------------------------------------------------</pre>

<h2><a name="1.9">1.9. Problems with shared libraries and CGI scripts</a></h2>

Occasionally, people run into problems with Python CGIs using modules which
require a specific shared library. Usually the problem manifests as a script
unable to find the shared library (the .so or .sl file).
<p>
After some newsgroup discussion, it was concluded that a simple shell script
which set some environment variables for the linker (most commonly,
LD_LIBRARY_PATH) and then started the Python script was the easiest
solution.</p>
<p>
Note that it might also be possible to set environment variables using some
directives in you httpd setup. For Apache, the env module supports this;
consult the documentation at <a
href="http://www.apache.org/docs/mod/mod_env.html">http://www.apache.org/docs/mod/mod_env.html</a>
for details.</p>

<h2><a name="2.2">2.2. What are templates and how can I use them?</a></h2>

HTML templates are a way to take all the HTML out of your program and put it
into a separate file.
<p>
(thanks to Skip Montanaro for the inspiration)</p>
<p>
Probably the easiest way to use html templates with your Python CGI's is to
use Python's built-in dictionary key substitution mechanism for strings.</p>
<p>
The way to do this is to use the % operator for strings, which works much like
printf() syntax does in C. The documentation for this can be found at  <a
href="http://www.python.org/doc/tut/node45.html#SECTION008100000000000000000">../documentation/tut/node45.html</a></p>
<p>
In short, your template file, called maybe "template.txt" will look something
like:</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<pre>     &lt;pre>
      Dear %(name)s,
        We really like your %(feature)s, and have awarded you the 
      %(feature)s-of-the-month award for %(month)s %(year)s. From all 
      of us here at Acme Awards, Congratulations!</pre>
<pre>                                              %(closing)s,
                                              Dave Mitchell
     &lt;/pre></pre>
<p>
And your dictionary will look like this:</p>
<p>
</p>
<pre>        def_dict = {'name': 'J.Q. Studmeyer',\
                      'feature': 'long nose',\
                      'month':        'April',\
                      'year':         '1996',\
                      'closing':      'very truly yours'}</pre>
<p>
So later in your code, when you say</p>
<p>
</p>
<pre>  templ = open("template.txt").read()
  print templ%(def_dict)</pre>

Your program will spit out:
<p>
</p>
<pre>     &lt;pre>
      Dear J.Q. Studmeyer,
        We really like your long nose, and have awarded you the 
      long nose-of-the-month award for April 1996. From all 
      of us here at Acme Awards, Congratulations!</pre>
<pre>                                              very truly yours,
                                              Dave Mitchell
     &lt;/pre></pre>

<h2><a name="2.3">2.3. What are cookies and how can I use them in my

Cookies, or netscape-cookies as they are sometimes called, implement a scheme
for web applications to store program state in the web client.
<p>
Each cookie contains several bits of information such as a variable name, a
value, an expiration date, and a path.</p>
<p>
The way the cookie works is whenever you request a url from a site, any cookie
that your browser is holding that is applicable is sent to the server along
with the request. This allows the server-side program to do things like track
a user's path through a site, or to provide authentication information such as
a user-id. Of course there are security concerns, so you don't want to be
storing things in a cookie that you really want to keep secret.</p>
<p>
The variable name and value are what you'd expect. There are limits on the
size of the name and value as well. I believe the value must be shorter than
2k in length, and the size of all cookies from one site must be shorter than
20k total. (please correct me if this is wrong).</p>
<p>
The path determines the locations on the site for while your cookie is valid.
For example, if your application lives at the url "/cgi-bin/myapp/myapp.cgi",
and it sets a cookie whose path is "/", then that cookie will be sent when you
visit any url on the whole site.</p>
<p>
The expiration date determines how long the cookie is valid for (or at least
the maximum lifetime for it).</p>
<p>
For a fuller explanation of the cookie protocol and uses, see Netscape's
documentation at <a
href="http://devedge.netscape.com/library/documentation/communicator/jsguide4/cookies.htm">http://devedge.netscape.com/library/documentation/communicator/jsguide4/cookies.htm</a></p>
<p>
To use cookies in your Python CGI scripts, Tim O'Malley maintains the module
"Cookie.py", which you can get from <a
href="ftp://ftp.bbn.com/pub/timo/python/Cookie.py">ftp://ftp.bbn.com/pub/timo/python/Cookie.py</a></p>
<p>
Using Cookie.py is pretty easy. In it, cookies work somewhat like python
dictionaries or the cgi FieldStorage class. To create a new cookie, you just
do something like</p>
<p>
>>> x = Cookie.Cookie()</p>
<p>
To set values in your new cookie, you just assign them, like</p>
<p>
>>> x['dave'] = "great"</p>
<p>
To get these cookies sent to the user's browser, you just "print" them before
your initial "Content-type" header. If you do it after this point, they won't
stick, and they'll likely appear in the browser window along with your script
output. If this happens you know it didn't work ;)</p>
<p>
>>> print C</p>
<p>
Set-Cookie: dave="great";</p>
<p>
Finally, a word of advice about cookies: the public has been scared by
alarmist articles in the news about how cookies are "stealing" your privacy
and credit card numbers and waist size, etc.. This just isn't true. Cookies
can only contain information that is otherwise known to the server or that you
entered into a form yourself. It can't just pull your credit card number and
waist size down from thin air. Another thing to know, many people actually do
turn on cookie warnings on their browsers, at least for a few days until they
get so sick of having to click "confirm" that they either enable or disable
them completely. You can't count on cookies to store your state. Unless you
have to, either don't use them, or use them only for a shortcut to information
that you could get some other way.</p>

<h2><a name="2.4">2.4. My CGI script doesn't work; from the command line it
runs fine</a></h2>

(See also question 1.2 on debugging.)
<p>
In other words, the same command or the same script works when you test it out
manually, but when you install it as a CGI script, nothing happens.</p>
<p>
Some possible causes:</p>
<p>
- Your CGI script is run as user "nobody". This user generally has minimal
permissions.  If you are reading or writing files, the files or directories
may not have the needed permissions.</p>
<p>
- Your ISP is running CGI scripts on a different machine than where you log in
to access the shell, and Python is not installed correctly there.</p>
<p>
To debug this situation, it helps tremendously if you have access to the http
server's error_log file (for apache servers, this is often in
/usr/local/etc/httpd/logs/error_log, or a similar name).</p>
<p>
Also make sure to read the section on debugging in the library manual section
for the cgi module, or in the doc string in cgi.py; it contains some hints
about systematic debugging of CGI scripts.</p>

<h2><a name="2.5">2.5. How do I run a delayed command from a CGI
script?</a></h2>

For example, say you want to run a command that updates a database after
you've verified the user input, but it's slow so you want the CGI script to
complete and continue the database update in the background.
<p>
If you try this naively, e.g. using</p>
<p>
</p>
<pre>    os.system("some_command &amp;")</pre>

you will find that some web servers wait until the command completes, thereby
defeating the purpose!
<p>
The reason is that the background command still has stdout and stderr open. 
The solution is to close these after the fork.  In the above example, this
should work (using Unix Bourne shell syntax):</p>
<pre>    os.system(" some_command >/dev/null 2>&amp;1 &amp; ")</pre>

If you're using os.fork() yourself, try os.close(1); os.close(2).

<h2><a name="2.7">2.7. How can I validate an email address in my
script?</a></h2>

This is a bit of a sticky wicket.. If you're looking to know for sure whether
or not you've got a real and valid email address, the only way to know for
sure is to send a mail and see if you get a response!
<p>
On the other hand, if you just want to make sure that the address isn't
obviously malformed, and at least "looks" like a valid email address, you're
in better shape.</p>
<p>
For this task, i've written module called email.py, which uses a carefully
written regex to try and match the useful part out of the raw and usually
bogus address that a clueless web user will input as "their email address".
There's not much you can do when they enter</p>
<p>
</p>
<pre>  <a href="http://members.aol.com/clueless/newbie.html">http://members.aol.com/clueless/newbie.html</a></pre>

as their email, but when it's something a little more reasonable like
<p>
</p>
<pre>  in%"<a href="mailto:davem@magnet.com">&lt;davem@magnet.com></a>"</pre>

as it might appear on a VAX, this program can do that just fine.
<p>
Until I can upload it on python.org, you can get it from my home page at <a
href="http://people.magnet.com/~davem/python/email.py">http://people.magnet.com/~davem/python/email.py</a></p>
<p>
Using it is simple. All you do is something like:</p>
<p>
</p>
<pre>  >>> import email
  >>> email.validate_email_addr('in%"<a href="mailto:davem@magnet.com">&lt;davem@magnet.com></a>"')
  '<a href="mailto:davem@magnet.com">&lt;davem@magnet.com></a>'
  >>> email.validate_email_addr("<a href="mailto:bogus@aol">&lt;bogus@aol></a>")
  ''  </pre>

In other words, if it can make sense of the email address, it returns the
cleaned up one. Otherwise it returns the null string.

<h2><a name="2.9">2.9. How does a CGI script figure out (the browser name / IP
address)?</a></h2>

CGI scripts get such information through environment variables, so you have to
look for values in the os.environ dictionary. Try running the following as a
CGI script to see a complete list of what your server provides.
<p>
</p>
<pre>    #!/usr/local/bin/python
    import os
    print 'Content-type: text/plain\n\n'
    for k,v in os.environ.items():
        print k, v</pre>

Some of the output from this CGI looks like:
<p>
</p>
<pre>    SERVER_PORT 80
    REMOTE_ADDR 10.27.10.38
    SERVER_SOFTWARE Apache/1.3.1 (Unix)
    GATEWAY_INTERFACE CGI/1.1
    HTTP_ACCEPT_LANGUAGE en
    REMOTE_PORT 54319
    HTTP_USER_AGENT Mozilla/4.5 [en] (X11; I; SunOS 5.6 sun4u)
    SERVER_PROTOCOL HTTP/1.0
    SCRIPT_NAME /cgi-bin/t.cgi
      ...</pre>

So, for the browser, you need to examine os.environ['HTTP_USER_AGENT'], and
for the remote IP address, you want os.environ['REMOTE_ADDR'].
<p>
(Note that someone may be running a weird browser that doesn't send a
User-Agent HTTP header, so you may not be able to count on
os.environ['HTTP_USER_AGENT'] always being there; code defensively,
particularly when writing CGI scripts...</p>

<h2><a name="2.10">2.10. How can a CGI script output graphics, such as a GIF
file?</a></h2>

Just tell the browser that you're sending an image by specifying the correct
MIME-type:
<p>
</p>
<pre>    import sys
    image = open('my.gif','rb').read()
    # HTTP Headers
    sys.stdout.write('Content-type: image/gif\r\n')
    # End-of-headers
    sys.stdout.write('\r\n')
    # Start of content
    sys.stdout.write(image)</pre>

Note that you can't use 'print image' since it would append a newline or a
blank (in case you use 'print image,') which the browser might not like.
<p>
This examples reads the GIF from a file; it's also possible to produce
graphics images through Python code, using a package such as the Python
Imaging Library (<a
href="http://www.python.org/sigs/image-sig/Imaging.html">http://www.python.org/sigs/image-sig/Imaging.html</a>).</p>
