<H1><A NAME="SECTION000400000000000000000">
<SPAN CLASS="arabic">3</SPAN>. Windows and Pads</A>
</H1>

<P>
Windows are the basic abstraction in curses.  A window object
represents a rectangular area of the screen, and supports various
 methods to display text, erase it, allow the user to input strings,
and so forth.

<P>
The <tt>stdscr</tt> object returned by the <tt>initwin()</tt> function
is a window object that covers the entire screen.  Many programs may
need only this single window, but you might wish to divide the screen
into smaller windows, in order to redraw or clear them separately.
The <tt>newwin()</tt> function creates a new window of a given size,
returning the new window object.

<P>
<dl><dd><pre>
begin_x = 20 ; begin_y = 7
height = 5 ; width = 40
win = curses.newwin(height, width, begin_y, begin_x)
</pre></dl>

<P>
A word about the coordinate system used in curses: coordinates are
always passed in the order <i>y,x</i>, and the top-left corner of a
window is coordinate (0,0).  This breaks a common convention for
handling coordinates, where the <i>x</i> coordinate usually comes
first.  This is an unfortunate difference from most other computer
applications, but it's been part of curses since it was first written,
and it's too late to change things now.

<P>
When you call a method to display or erase text, the effect doesn't
immediately show up on the display.  This is because curses was
originally written with slow 300-baud terminal connections in mind;
with these terminals, minimizing the time required to redraw the
screen is very important.  This lets curses accumulate changes to the
screen, and display them in the most efficient manner.  For example,
if your program displays some characters in a window, and then clears
the window, there's no need to send the original characters because
they'd never be visible.  

<P>
Accordingly, curses requires that you explicitly tell it to redraw
windows, using the <tt>refresh()</tt> method of window objects.  In
practice, this doesn't really complicate programming with curses much.
Most programs go into a flurry of activity, and then pause waiting for
a keypress or some other action on the part of the user.  All you have
to do is to be sure that the screen has been redrawn before pausing to
wait for user input, by simply calling <tt>stdscr.refresh()</tt> or the
<tt>refresh()</tt> method of some other relevant window.

<P>
A pad is a special case of a window; it can be larger than the actual
display screen, and only a portion of it displayed at a time.
Creating a pad simply requires the pad's height and width, while
refreshing a pad requires giving the coordinates of the on-screen
area where a subsection of the pad will be displayed.  

<P>
<dl><dd><pre>
pad = curses.newpad(100, 100)
#  These loops fill the pad with letters; this is
# explained in the next section
for y in range(0, 100):
    for x in range(0, 100):
        try: pad.addch(y,x, ord('a') + (x*x+y*y) % 26 )
except curses.error: pass

#  Displays a section of the pad in the middle of the screen
pad.refresh( 0,0, 5,5, 20,75)
</pre></dl>

<P>
The <tt>refresh()</tt> call displays a section of the pad in the
rectangle extending from coordinate (5,5) to coordinate (20,75) on the
screen;the upper left corner of the displayed section is coordinate
(0,0) on the pad.  Beyond that difference, pads are exactly like
ordinary windows and support the same methods.
