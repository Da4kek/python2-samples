<SPAN CLASS="arabic">1</SPAN>. Introduction to XML</A>
</H1>

<P>
XML, the eXtensible Markup Language, is a simplified dialect of SGML,
the Standardized General Markup Language.  XML is intended to be
reasonably simple to implement and use, and is already being used for
specifying markup languages for various new standards: MathML for
expressing mathematical equations, XXX SMIL (Expand acronym) for
synchronizing multimedia objects, and so forth.

<P>
SGML and XML represent a document by tagging the document's various
components with their function, or meaning.  For example, an academic
paper contains several parts: it has a title, one or more authors, an
abstract, the actual text of the paper, a list of references, and so
forth.  A markup languge for writing such papers would therefore have
tags for indicating what the contents of the abstract are, what the
title is, and so forth.  This should not be confused with the physical
details of how the document is actually printed on paper.  The
abstract might be printed with narrow margins in a smaller font than
the rest of the document, but the markup usually won't be concerned
with details such as this; other software will translate from the
markup language to a typesetting language such as <SPAN CLASS="logo TeX">T<SMALL>E</SMALL>X</SPAN>, and will
handle the details.

<P>
A markup language specified using XML looks a lot like HTML; a
document consists of a single <i>element</i>, which contains
sub-elements, which can have further sub-elements inside them.
Elements are indicated by <i>tags</i> in the text.  Tags are always
inside angle brackets <tt>&lt;</tt>&nbsp;<tt>&gt;</tt>.  There are two forms of
elements.  An element can contain content between opening and closing
tags, as in <tt>&lt;name&gt;Euryale&lt;/name&gt;</tt>, which is a <tt>name</tt>
element containing the data "<tt>Euryale</tt>". This content may be text
data, other XML elements, or a mixture of both.  Elements can also be
empty, in which case they contain nothing, and are represented as a
single tag ended with a slash, as in <tt>&lt;stop/&gt;</tt>, which is an empty
<tt>stop</tt> element.  Unlike HTML, XML element names are
case-sensitive; <tt>stop</tt> and <tt>Stop</tt> are two different
element types.

<P>
Opening and empty tags can also contain attributes, which specify
values associated with an element.  For example, text such as
<tt>&lt;name lang='greek'&gt;Herakles&lt;/name&gt;</tt>, the <tt>name</tt> element
has a <tt>lang</tt> attribute which has a value of "<tt>greek</tt>".
This would contrast with <tt>&lt;name lang='latin'&gt;Hercules&lt;/name&gt;</tt>,
where the attribute's value is "<tt>latin</tt>".

<P>
A given XML language is specified with a Document Type Definition, or
<i>DTD</i>.  The DTD declares the element names that are allowed, and
how elements can be nested inside each other.  The DTD also specifies
the attributes that can be provided for each element, their default
values, and if they can be omitted.  For example, to take an example
from HTML, the <tt>LI</tt> element, representing an entry in a list,
can only occur inside certain elements which represent lists, such as
<tt>OL</tt> or <tt>UL</tt>.  A <i>validating parser</i> can be given
a DTD and a document, and verify whether a given document is legal
according to the DTD's rules, or determine that one or more rules have
been violated.

<P>
Applications that process XML can be classed into two types.  The
simplest class is an application that only handles one particular
markup language.  For example, a chemistry program may only need to
process Chemical Markup Language, but not MathML.  This
application can therefore be written specifically for a single DTD,
and doesn't need to be capable of handling multiple markup
languages.  This type is simpler to write, and can easily be
implemented with the available Python software.

<P>
The second type of application is less common, and has to be able to
handle any markup language you throw at it.  An example might be a
smart XML editor that helps you to write XML that conforms to a
selected DTD; it might do so by not letting you enter an element where
it would be illegal, or by suggesting elements that can be placed at
the current cursor location.  Such an application needs to handle any
possible XML-defined markup, and therefore must be able to obtain a
data structure embodying the DTD in use.  XXX This type of application
can't currently be implemented in Python without difficulty (XXX but
wait and see if a DTD module is included...)

<P>
For the full details of XML's syntax, the one definitive source is the
XML 1.0 specification, available on the Web at
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xml-spec.html"><font face=sans-serif>http://www.w3.org/TR/xml-spec.html</font></a>.  However, like all
specifications, it's quite formal and isn't intended to be a friendly
introduction or a tutorial.  The annotated version of the standard, at
<a href="http://www.xml.com/XXX"><font face=sans-serif>http://www.xml.com/XXX</font></a>, is quite helpful in clarifying the
specification's intent.  There are also various informal tutorials and
books available to introduce you to XML.

<P>
The rest of this HOWTO will assume that you're familiar with the
relevant terminology.  Most section will use XML terms such as
<i>element</i> and <i>attribute</i>; section&nbsp;<A HREF="DOM.html#DOM">4</A> on the Document
Object Model will assume that you've read the relevant Working Draft,
and are familiar with things like Iterators and Nodes.
Section&nbsp;<A HREF="SAX.html#SAX">3</A> does not require that you have experience with the
Java SAX implentations.
