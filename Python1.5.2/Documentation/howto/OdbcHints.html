Python ODBC Note (Windows only)

<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/data/odbc/default.htm">Open Database Connectivity (ODBC)</a> is an API that provides a uniform
method for SQL based data access across a wide variety of database
systems. This feat is accomplished using installable drivers for each
type of database. ODBC is not a "least common denominator" solution,
though. The API provides extensive facilities for discovering and
using advanced features of the target databases, such as locking,
outer joins, scrollable cursors, stored procedures, and so on. If your
Python application needs to communicate with different backends,
particularly relational servers like Oracle, Sybase or SQL Server,
ODBC is a reasonable solution.

There are (at least) three ways to access ODBC from Python on the
Windows platform:
   I. DB API    - Python Database API
  II. calldll   - Sam Rushing's calldll module
 III. DAO       - Microsoft Data Access Objects

We'll only be discusssing the first two options here. Option III, DAO,
is a COM interface to the Microsoft Jet Engine that can also access
ODBC databases, but the API looks nothing like ODBC, and COM is beyond
the scope of this Note. However, if Jet/Access is your primary
database, or you happen to like that interface, DAO may be a good
choice for ODBC connectivity.

I. ODBC using Python Database API

The Python Database API is an effort by the db-sig to provide a
uniform interface for tabular data access in Python (see the db-sig
page, <a href="http://www.python.org/sigs/db-sig">http://www.python.org/sigs/db-sig/</a>, for more information).  Mark
Hammond's win32 extensions contain an ODBC implementation of this API
- odbc.pyd. The DB API only exposes limited ODBC functionality (that
isn't its purpose), but it is simple to use and comes free with win32.

To set up odbc.pyd:
  1. Install the Python windows binary:
     <a href="http://www.python.org/ftp/python/win32/python15.exe">http://www.python.org/ftp/python/win32/python15.exe</a>
  2. Install Mark Hammond's win32 extensions:
     <a href="http://www.python.org/windows/win32/win32.exe">http://www.python.org/windows/win32/win32.exe</a>
  3. Install any necessary ODBC drivers and configure a datasource for
     your target database(s) using the ODBC Administrator.

Your aplication will need to import two modules:
  dbi.dll  - support classes for various SQL data types, e.g. dates
  odbc.pyd - the compiled ODBC interface

Here is an example:
   import dbi, odbc     # ODBC modules
   import time          # standard time module

   dbc = odbc.odbc(     # open a database connection
       'sample/monty/spam'  # 'datasource/user/password'
       )
   crsr = dbc.cursor()  # create a cursor
   crsr.execute(        # execute some SQL
       """
       SELECT country_id, name, insert_change_date
       FROM country
       ORDER BY name
       """
       )
   print 'Column descriptions:'  # show column descriptions
   for col in crsr.description:
       print ' ', col
   result = crsr.fetchall()      # fetch the results all at once
   print '\nFirst result row:\n ', result[0]  # show first result row
   print '\nDate conversions:'   # play with dbiDate object
   date = result[0][-1]
   fmt = '  %-25s%-20s'
   print fmt % ('standard string:', str(date))
   print fmt % ('seconds since epoch:', float(date))
   timeTuple = time.localtime(date)
   print fmt % ('time tuple:', timeTuple)
   print fmt % ('user defined:', time.strftime('%d %B %Y', timeTuple))
   -------------------------------output--------------------------------

   Column descriptions:
     ('country_id', 'NUMBER', 12, 10, 10, 0, 0)
     ('name', 'STRING', 45, 45, 0, 0, 0)
     ('insert_change_date', 'DATE', 19, 19, 0, 0, 1)

   First result row:
     (24L, 'ARGENTINA', &lt;DbiDate object at 7f1c80&gt;)

   Date conversions:
     standard string:         Fri Dec 19 01:51:53 1997
     seconds since epoch:     882517913.0
     time tuple:              (1997, 12, 19, 1, 51, 53, 4, 353, 0)
     user defined:            19 December 1997

See also <a href="http://www.python.org/windows/win32/odbc.html">http://www.python.org/windows/win32/odbc.html</a> for sample
code and notes by Hirendra Hindocha.

Notice that result values are converted to Python objects. Dates in
particular are returned as dbiDate objects. This can be a serious
limitation, because dbiDate can not represent dates prior to the UNIX
epoch (1 Jan 1970 00:00:00 GMT). If you try to retrieve earlier dates,
you'll get garbage and may even provoke a crash.

You'll want to download the win32 source and examine odbc.cpp to see
which features are currently provided. For example, transaction
facilities (setautocommit, commit and rollback) are available, but
SQLDriverConnect (needed to supply extra parameters to the driver) is
not.

If you don't need any of these facilities, you're set. Otherwise, read
on.

II. ODBC using calldll

<a href="mailto:rushing@squrl.nightmare.com">Sam Rushing</a>'s calldll module lets Python call any function in any
DLL. In particular, you can get at ODBC by directly calling functions
in odbc32.dll, and Sam has provided a wrapper module, odbc.py, to do
just that. There is also code for managing data sources, installing
ODBC itself, and creating and maintaining Jet (Microsoft Access)
databases. Poke through the demos and sample code. There are some
amazing things, like cbdemo.py, which has a message loop and window
procedure implemented as Python functions!

[You can find links to the calldll package on Sam's <a href="http://nightmare.com/software.html">Python Software</a>
page.]

To set up calldll as a package:
  1. Install python 1.5 (not 1.4!) as above
  2. Get calldll.zip:
     ftp://squirl.nightmare.com/pub/python/python-ext/calldll.zip
  3. Create a new directory, calldll, under the lib directory, e.g.
     c:\Program Files\Python\lib\caldll\
  4. Unpack calldll.zip into this directory using WinZip, pkunzip, etc.
  5. Move all the files in the calldll\lib\ subdirectory (created by
     the unzip) up to the parent (calldll) directory and delete the lib
     subdirectory
  6. Create the file __init__.py in the calldll directory and put
     a suitable comment in it:
     # File to allow this directory to be treated as a python 1.5
package.
  7. Edit calldll\odbc.py to fix a bug in the get_info facility:
     In the functions "get_info_word" and "get_info_long", change
     "calldll.membuf" to "windll.membuf"

Here is an example using calldll:
   from calldll import odbc

   dbc = odbc.environment().connection()   # create connection
   dbc.connect('sample', 'monty', 'spam')  # connect to db
   # alternatively, use full connect string:
   # dbc.driver_connect('DSN=sample;UID=monty;PWD=spam')
   print 'DBMS: %s %s\n' % (    # show DB information
       dbc.get_info(odbc.SQL_DBMS_NAME),
       dbc.get_info(odbc.SQL_DBMS_VER)
       )
   result = dbc.query(          # execute query & return results
       """
       SELECT country_id, name, insert_change_date
       FROM country
       ORDER BY name
       """
       )
   print 'Column descriptions:' # show column descriptions
   for col in result[0]:
       print ' ', col
   print '\nFirst result row:\n ', result[1]  # show first result row
   -------------------------------output--------------------------------

   DBMS: Oracle 07.30.0000

   Column descriptions:
     ('COUNTRY_ID', 3, 10, 0, 0)
     ('NAME', 12, 45, 0, 0)
     ('INSERT_CHANGE_DATE', 11, 19, 0, 1)

   First result row:
     ['24', 'ARGENTINA', '1997-12-19 01:51:53']

Notice that result values are returned as strings, so dates aren't a
problem, and you have access to SQLDriverConnect in case you need to
supply a connect string. You'll want to examine odbc.py to discover
all the available features. And if you need some facility that isn't
provided, you can easily add it *without* firing up a C compiler.

Suppose, for example, that you need to handle transactions. This
requires the ability to turn off autocommit mode and execute a commit
or a rollback. First, figure out which ODBC functions you need to
call, then add the wrappers to odbc.py, using the existing functions
as guides. When in doubt, experiment! You'll obviously need ODBC
documentation for this. You can download the ODBC 3.0 Programmer's
Reference (in Help file format) or the whole SDK, for free, from
Microsoft: <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/data/odbc/download.htm">http://www.microsoft.com/data/odbc/download.htm</a>

To handle transactions, we can add the following methods to the
connection class:
    def autocommit(self, value=1):
        if value:
            value = 1  # SQL_AUTOCOMMIT_ON
        else:
            value = 0  # SQL_AUTOCOMMIT_OFF
        return odbc.SQLSetConnectAttr(
            self,  # connection
            102,   # attribute = SQL_ATTR_AUTOCOMMMIT
            value, # ptr or value
            -5     # len = SQL_IS_UINTEGER
            )

    def commit(self):
        return odbc.SQLEndTran(
            2,     # handle type = SQL_Handle_DBC
            self,  # handle
            0      # SQL_Commit
            )

    def rollback(self):
        return odbc.SQLEndTran(
            2,     # handle type = SQL_Handle_DBC
            self,  # handle
            1      # SQL_Rollback
            )

Notes: 1. SQLSetConnectAttr and SQLEndTran are ODBC 3.0 functions, so
you'll need an ODBC 3.0 Driver Manager (2.x drivers are OK though);
2. The literals are meant to keep the example self-contained, in
practice you should define the appropriate constants in odbc.py

With this code you can now handle transactions:
    dbc.autocommit(0)    # turn off autocommit
    dbc.commit()         # commit or rollback as required
    dbc.rolback()

Good luck, and if you make any significant extensions to odbc.py, be
sure to share them!
