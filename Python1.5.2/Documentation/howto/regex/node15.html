</H2>

<P>
Elaborate REs may use many groups, both to capture substrings of
interest, and to group and structure the RE itself.  In complex REs,
it becomes difficult to keep track of the group numbers.  There are
two features which help with this problem.  Both of them use a common
syntax for regular expression extensions, so we'll look at that first.

<P>
Perl 5 added several additional features to standard regular
expressions, and the Python <tt>re</tt> module supports most of them.
It would have been difficult to choose new single-keystroke
metacharacters or new special sequences beginning with "<tt>&#92;</tt>" to
represent the new features, without making Perl's regular expressions
confusingly different from standard REs.  If you chose "<tt>&amp;</tt>" as a
new metacharacter, for example, old expressions would be assuming that
"<tt>&amp;</tt>" was a regular character and wouldn't have escaped it by
writing <tt>&#92;&amp;</tt> or <tt>[&amp;]</tt>.  The solution chosen was to
use <tt>(?...)</tt> as the extension syntax.  "<tt>?</tt>" immediately
after a parenthesis was a syntax error, because the "<tt>?</tt>" would
have nothing to repeat, so this doesn't introduce any compatibility
problems.  The characters immediately after the "<tt>?</tt>"  indicate
what extension is being used, so <tt>(?=foo)</tt> is one thing (a
positive lookahead assertion) and <tt>(?:foo)</tt> is something else
(a non-capturing group containing the subexpression <tt>foo</tt>).

<P>
Python adds an extension syntax to Perl's extension syntax.  If the
first character after the question mark is a "<tt>P</tt>", you know that
it's a extension that's specific to Python.  Currently there are two
such extensions: <tt>(?P&lt;<i>name</i>&gt;...)</tt> defines a named group,
and <tt>(?P=<i>name</i>)</tt> is a backreference to a named group.  If
future versions of Perl 5 add similar features using a different
syntax, the <tt>re</tt> module will be changed to support the new
syntax, while preserving the Python-specific syntax for
compatibility's sake.

<P>
Now that we've looked at the general extension syntax, we can return
to the features that simplify working with groups in complex REs.
Since groups are numbered from left to right, and a complex expression
may use many groups, it can become difficult to keep track of the
correct numbering, and modifying such a complex RE is annoying.
Insert a new group near the beginning, and you change the numbers of
everything that follows it.

<P>
First, sometimes you'll want to use a group to collect a part of a
regular expression, but aren't interested in retrieving the group's
contents.  You can make this fact explicit by using a non-capturing
group: <tt>(?:...)</tt>, where you can put any other regular
expression inside the parentheses.  

<P>
<dl><dd><pre>
&gt;&gt;&gt; m = re.match("([abc])+'', "abc")
&gt;&gt;&gt; m.groups()
('c',)
&gt;&gt;&gt; m = re.match("(?:[abc])+", "abc")
&gt;&gt;&gt; m.groups()
()
</pre></dl>

<P>
Except for the fact that you can't retrieve the contents of what the
group matched, a non-capturing group behaves exactly the same as a
capturing group; you can put anything inside it, repeat it with a
repetition metacharacter such as "<tt>*</tt>", and nest it within other
groups (capturing or non-capturing).  <tt>(?:...)</tt> is particularly
useful when modifying an existing group, since you can add new groups
without changing how all the other groups are numbered.  It should be
mentioned that there's no performance difference in searching between
capturing and non-capturing groups; neither form is any faster than
the other.

<P>
The second, and more significant, feature, is named groups; instead of
referring to them by numbers, groups can be referenced by a name.

<P>
The syntax for a named group is one of the Python-specific extensions:
<tt>(?P&lt;<i>name</i>&gt;...)</tt>.  <i>name</i> is, obviously, the name of
the group.  Except for associating a name with a group, named groups
also behave identically to capturing groups.  The <tt>MatchObject</tt>
methods that deal with capturing groups all accept either integers, to
refer to groups by number, or a string containing the group name.
Named groups are still given numbers, so you can retrieve information
about a group in two ways:

<P>
<dl><dd><pre>
&gt;&gt;&gt; p = re.compile(r'(?P&lt;word&gt;\b\w+\b)')
&gt;&gt;&gt; m = p.search( '(((( Lots of punctuation )))' )
&gt;&gt;&gt; m.group('word')
'Lots'
&gt;&gt;&gt; m.group(1)
'Lots'
</pre></dl>
Named groups are handy because they let you use easily-remembered
names, instead of having to remember numbers.  Here's an example RE
from the "<tt>imaplib</tt>" module:

<P>
<dl><dd><pre>
InternalDate = re.compile(r'INTERNALDATE "'
        r'(?P&lt;day&gt;[ 123][0-9])-(?P&lt;mon&gt;[A-Z][a-z][a-z])-'
	r'(?P&lt;year&gt;[0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9])'
        r' (?P&lt;hour&gt;[0-9][0-9]):(?P&lt;min&gt;[0-9][0-9]):(?P&lt;sec&gt;[0-9][0-9])'
        r' (?P&lt;zonen&gt;[-+])(?P&lt;zoneh&gt;[0-9][0-9])(?P&lt;zonem&gt;[0-9][0-9])'
        r'"')
</pre></dl>
It's obviously much easier to retrieve <tt>m.group('zonem')</tt>,
instead of having to remember to retrieve group 9.

<P>
Since the syntax for backreferences refers to the number of the group,
in an expression like <tt>(...)&#92;1</tt>, there's naturally a variant
that uses the group name instead of the number.  This is also a Python
extension: <tt>?P=<i>name</i>)</tt> indicates that the contents of the
group called <i>name</i> should again be found at the current point.  
The regular expression for finding doubled words, 
<tt>(&#92;b&#92;w+)&#92;s+&#92;1</tt> can also be written as
<tt>(?P&lt;word&gt;&#92;b&#92;w+)&#92;s+(?P=word)</tt>:

<P>
<dl><dd><pre>
&gt;&gt;&gt; p = re.compile(r'(?P&lt;word&gt;\b\w+)\s+(?P=word)')
&gt;&gt;&gt; p.search('Paris in the the spring').group()
'the the'
</pre></dl>
