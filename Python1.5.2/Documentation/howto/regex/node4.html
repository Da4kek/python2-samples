</H2>

<P>
Most letters and characters will simply match themselves.  For
example, the regular expression <tt>test</tt> will match the string
"<tt>test</tt>" exactly.  (You can enable a case-insensitive mode that
would let this RE match "<tt>Test</tt>" or "<tt>TEST</tt>" as well; more
about this later.)  

<P>
There are exceptions to this rule; some characters are
special, and don't match themselves.  Instead, they signal that some
out-of-the-ordinary thing should be matched, or they affect other
portions of the RE by repeating them.  Much of this document is
devoted to discussing various metacharacters and what they do.

<P>
Here's a complete list of the metacharacters; their meanings will be discussed 
in the rest of this HOWTO.

<P>
<dl><dd><pre>
. ^ $ * + ? { [ \ | ( )
</pre></dl>
The first metacharacter we'll look at is "<tt>[</tt>"; it's used for
specifying a character class, which is a set of characters that you
wish to match.  Characters can be listed individually, or a range of
characters can be indicated by giving two characters and separating
them by a "<tt>-</tt>".  For example, <tt>[abc]</tt> will match any
of the characters "<tt>a</tt>", "<tt>b</tt>", or "<tt>c</tt>"; this is the same as
<tt>[a-c]</tt>, which uses a range to express the same set of
characters.  If you wanted to match only lowercase letters, your
RE would be <tt>[a-z]</tt>.

<P>
Metacharacters are not active inside classes.  For example, <tt>[akm$]</tt>
will match any of the characters "<tt>a</tt>", "<tt>k</tt>",
"<tt>m</tt>", or "<tt>$</tt>"; "<tt>$</tt>" is usually a metacharacter, but inside a character class it's stripped
of its special nature.

<P>
You can match the characters not within a range by <i>complementing</i>
the set.  This is indicated by including a "<tt>^</tt>" as the first
character of the class; "<tt>^</tt>" elsewhere will simply match the
"<tt>^</tt>" character.  For example, <tt>[5]</tt> will match any
character except "<tt>5</tt>".

<P>
Perhaps the most important metacharacter is the backslash, "<tt>&#92;</tt>".  
As in Python string literals, the backslash can be followed by various
characters to signal various special sequences.  It's also used to escape
all the metacharacters so you can still match them in patterns; for
example, if you need to match a "<tt>[</tt>" or 
"<tt>&#92;</tt>", you can precede them with a backslash to remove their
special meaning: <tt>&#92;[</tt> or <tt>&#92;&#92;</tt>.

<P>
Some of these special sequences represent predefined sets of
characters that are often useful, such as the set of digits, or the
set of letters, or the set of anything that isn't whitespace.  The
following predefined special sequences are available:

<P>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><tt>&#92;d</tt>
<DD>Matches any decimal digit; this is
equivalent to the class <tt>[0-9]</tt>.
<DT><tt>&#92;D</tt>
<DD>Matches any non-digit character; this is
equivalent to the class <tt>[0-9]</tt>.
<DT><tt>&#92;s</tt>
<DD>Matches any whitespace character; this is
equivalent to the class <tt>[ &#92;t&#92;n&#92;r&#92;f&#92;v]</tt>.
<DT><tt>&#92;S</tt>
<DD>Matches any non-whitespace character; this is
equivalent to the class <tt>[^ &#92;t&#92;n&#92;r&#92;f&#92;v]</tt>.
<DT><tt>&#92;w</tt>
<DD>Matches any alphanumeric character; this is equivalent to the class
<tt>[a-zA-Z0-9_]</tt>.
<DT><tt>&#92;W</tt>
<DD>Matches any non-alphanumeric character; this is equivalent to the class
<tt>[&#226;-zA-Z0-9_]</tt>.   
</DL>

<P>
These sequences can be included inside a character class.  For
example, <tt>[&#92;s,.]</tt> is a character class that will match any
whitespace character, or "<tt>,</tt>" or "<tt>.</tt>".

<P>
The final metacharacter in this section is <tt>.</tt>.  It matches
anything except a newline character, and there's an alternate mode
(<tt>re.DOTALL</tt>) where it will match even a newline.  "<tt>.</tt>"
is often used where you want to match ``any character''.
