<P>
Being able to match varying sets of characters is the first thing
regular expressions can do that isn't already possible with Python's
<tt>string</tt> module.  However, if that was the only additional
capability of regexes, they wouldn't be much of an advance over
<tt>string</tt>.  The second capability is that you can specify that
portions of the RE must be repeated a certain number of times.

<P>
The first metacharacter for repeating things that we'll look at it is
<tt>*</tt>.  <tt>*</tt> doesn't match the literal character "<tt>*</tt>";
instead, it specifies that the previous character can be matched zero
or more times, instead of exactly once.

<P>
For example, <tt>ca*t</tt> will match "<tt>ct</tt>" (0 "<tt>a</tt>"
characters), "<tt>cat</tt>" (1 "<tt>a</tt>"), "<tt>caaat</tt>" (3 "<tt>a</tt>"
characters), and so forth.  The RE  engine has various internal
limitations, stemming from the size of C's <tt>int</tt> type, that will
prevent it from matching over 2 billion "<tt>a</tt>" characters; you
probably don't have enough memory to construct a string that large,  so you
shouldn't run into that limit.

<P>
Repetitions such as <tt>*</tt> are <i>greedy</i>; when repeating a RE,
the matching engine will try to repeat it as many times as possible.
If later portions of the pattern don't match, the matching engine will
then back up and try again with few repetitions.

<P>
A step-by-step example will make this more obvious.  Let's consider
the expression <tt>a[bcd]*b</tt>.  This matches the letter
"<tt>a</tt>", zero or more letters from the class <tt>[bcd]</tt>, and
finally ends with a "<tt>b</tt>".  Now imagine matching this RE
against the string "<tt>abcbd</tt>".  

<P>
<table border align=center>
  <tr><th><b>Step</b></th>
      <th align=left><b>Matched</b></th>
      <th align=left><b>Explanation</b></th>
<tr><td align=center>1</td>
      <td><tt>a</tt></td>
      <td>The <tt>a</tt> in the RE matches.</td>
<tr><td align=center>2</td>
      <td><tt>abcbd</tt></td>
      <td>The engine matches <tt>[bcd]*</tt>, going as far as
it can, which is to the end of the string.</td>
<tr><td align=center>3</td>
      <td><i>Failure</i></td>
      <td>The engine tries to match <tt>b</tt>, but the
current position is at the end of the string, so it fails.</td>
<tr><td align=center>4</td>
      <td><tt>abcb</tt></td>
      <td>Back up, so that  <tt>[bcd]*</tt> matches
one less character.</td>
<tr><td align=center>5</td>
      <td><i>Failure</i></td>
      <td>Try <tt>b</tt> again, but the
current position is at the last character, which is a "<tt>d</tt>".</td>
<tr><td align=center>6</td>
      <td><tt>abc</tt></td>
      <td>Back up again, so that  <tt>[bcd]*</tt> is
only matching "<tt>bc</tt>".</td>
<tr><td align=center>6</td>
      <td><tt>abcb</tt></td>
      <td>Try <tt>b</tt> again.  This time 
but the character at the current position is "<tt>b</tt>", so it succeeds.</td>

</table>

<P>
The end of the RE has now been reached, and it has matched
"<tt>abcb</tt>".  This demonstrates how the matching engine goes as far as
it can at first, and if no match is found, it will then progressively
back up and retry the rest of the RE again and again.  It will back up
until it's tried zero matches for <tt>[bcd]*</tt>, and if that
subsequently fails, it will conclude that the string doesn't match the
RE at all.

<P>
Another repeating metacharacter is <tt>+</tt>, which matches one or
more times.  Pay careful attention to the difference between
<tt>*</tt> and 
<BR>
regexp+; <tt>*</tt> matches <i>zero</i> or more
times, so whatever's being repeated may not be present at all, while
<tt>+</tt> requires at least <i>one</i> occurrence.  To use a similar
example, <tt>ca+t</tt> will match "<tt>cat</tt>" (1 "<tt>a</tt>"),
"<tt>caaat</tt>" (3 "<tt>a</tt>"'s), but won't match "<tt>ct</tt>".

<P>
There are two more repeating qualifiers.  The question mark character,
<tt>?</tt>, matches either once or zero times; you can think of it as
marking something as being optional.  For example, <tt>home-?brew</tt>
matches either "<tt>homebrew</tt>" or "<tt>home-brew</tt>".  

<P>
The most complicated repeated qualifier is
<tt>{<i>m</i>,<i>n</i>}</tt>, where <i>m</i> and <i>n</i> are decimal
numbers.  This means there must be at least <i>m</i> repetitions, and
at most <i>n</i>.  For example, <tt>a/{1,3}b</tt> 
will match "<tt>a/b</tt>", "<tt>a//b</tt>", and "<tt>a///b</tt>".  
It won't match "<tt>ab</tt>", which has no slashes, or "<tt>a////b</tt>",
which has four.

<P>
You can omit <i>n</i> (but not <i>m</i>); omitting <i>n</i> results in an
upper bound of infinity -- actually, the 2 billion limit mentioned
earlier, but that might as well be infinity.

<P>
Readers of a reductionist bent may notice that the 3 other qualifiers
can all be expressed using this notation.  
<tt>{0,}</tt> is the same as <tt>*</tt>,
<tt>{1,}</tt> is equivalent to <tt>+</tt>,
and <tt>{0,1}</tt> is the same as <tt>?</tt>.  It's better to use
<tt>*</tt>, <tt>+</tt>, or <tt>?</tt>, simply because they're shorter
and easier to read.
