<SPAN CLASS="arabic">4</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">4</SPAN> Other Assertions</A>
</H2>

<P>
Another zero-width assertion is the lookahead assertion.  Lookahead
assertions are available in both positive and negative form, and 
look like this:

<P>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><tt>(?=...)</tt>
<DD>Positive lookahead assertion.  This succeeds
if the contained regular expression, represented here by <tt>...</tt>,
successfully matches at the current location, and fails otherwise.
But, once the contained expression has been tried, the matching engine
doesn't advance at all; the rest of the pattern is tried right where
the assertion started.

<P>
<DT><tt>(?!...)</tt>
<DD>Negative lookahead assertion.  This is the
opposite of the positive assertion; it succeeds if the contained expression
<i>doesn't</i> match at the current position in the string.
</DL>

<P>
An example will help make this concrete, and will demonstrate a case
where a lookahead is useful.  Consider a simple pattern to match a
filename, and split it apart into a base name and an extension,
separated by a "<tt>.</tt>".  For example, in "<tt>news.rc</tt>", "<tt>news</tt>"
is the base name, and "<tt>rc</tt>" is the filename's extension.  

<P>
The pattern to match this is quite simple: <tt>.*[.].*$</tt>.
(Notice that the "<tt>.</tt>" needs to be treated specially because it's a
metacharacter; I've put it inside a character class.  Also notice the
trailing <tt>$</tt>; this is added to ensure that all the rest of the
string must be included in the extension.)  This regular expression
matches "<tt>foo.bar</tt>" and "<tt>autoexec.bat</tt>" and "<tt>sendmail.cf</tt>" and
"<tt>printers.conf</tt>".

<P>
Now, consider complicating the problem a bit; what if you want to
match filenames where the extension is not "<tt>bat</tt>"?
Some incorrect attempts:

<P>
<tt>.*[.][b].*$</tt>

<P>
First attempt: Exclude "<tt>bat</tt>" by requiring that the first
character of the extension is not a "<tt>b</tt>".  This is wrong, because it 
also doesn't match
"<tt>foo.bar</tt>".

<P>
<tt>.*[.]([b]..|.[&#226;].|..[t])$</tt>

<P>
The expression gets messier when you try to patch up the first
solution by requiring one of the following cases must match: the first
character of the extension isn't
"<tt>b</tt>"; the second character isn't "<tt>a</tt>"; or the third
character isn't "<tt>t</tt>".  This accepts "<tt>foo.bar</tt>" and rejects
"<tt>autoexec.bat</tt>", but it requires a three-letter extension, and doesn't accept "<tt>sendmail.cf</tt>".  Another bug, so we'll complicate the pattern again in an effort to fix it.

<P>
<tt>.*[.]([b].?.?|.[&#226;]?.?|..?[t]?)$</tt>

<P>
In the third attempt, the second and third letters are all made
optional in order to allow matching extensions shorter than three
characters, such as "<tt>sendmail.cf</tt>".

<P>
The pattern's getting really complicated now, which makes it hard to
read and understand.  When you write a regular expression, ask
yourself: if you encountered this expression in a program, how hard
would it be to figure out what the expression was intended to do?
Worse, this solution doesn't scale well; if the problem changes, and you want to exclude
both
"<tt>bat</tt>" and "<tt>exe</tt>" as extensions, the pattern would get still more complicated and confusing.

<P>
A negative lookahead cuts through all this.  Go back to the original
pattern, and, before the <tt>.*</tt> which matches the extension,
insert <tt>(?!bat$)</tt>.  This means: if the expression <tt>bat</tt>
doesn't match at this point, try the rest of the pattern; if
<tt>bat$</tt> does match, the whole pattern will fail.  (The trailing
<tt>$</tt> is required to ensure that something like
"<tt>sample.batch</tt>", where the extension only starts with "<tt>bat</tt>",
will be allowed.

<P>
After this modification, the whole pattern is
<tt>.*[.](?!bat$).*$</tt>.  Excluding another filename extension is
now easy; simply add it as an alternative inside the assertion.
<tt>.*[.](?!bat$|exe$).*$</tt>
excludes both "<tt>bat</tt>" and "<tt>exe</tt>".
