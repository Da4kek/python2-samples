<P>
For some applications, it's desirable to execute chunks of Python code
that come from an outside source.  The most obvious example is a Web
browser such as Grail, which can download and execute applets written in
Python.

<P>
An obvious danger of downloading and running code from anywhere is that
someone might write a malicious applet that appears to be harmless, but
silently erases files, makes copies of sensitive data, or gives the
applet's author a back door into your system.  The solution is to run
the code in a restricted environment, where it's prevented from
performing any operations that could be used maliciously.  

<P>
Java does this by using the Java Virtual Machine, which executes Java
bytecode.  The virtual machine, or VM, has complete control over the
running applet, and any dangerous operations must go through the VM in
order to be performed.  The VM can therefore trap suspicious activity,
and stop the applet's execution, if a strict security policy is used, or
ask the user if the operation should be permitted, if the policy is
somewhat looser.

<P>
Python already has a virtual machine that executes Python byte codes, so
creating a restricted execution environment simply requires sealing off
dangerous built-in functions such as <tt>open()</tt>, and dangerous
modules, such as the <tt>socket</tt> module.  This can be done by creating
new namespaces, removing any dangerous functions, and forcing code to be
executed in those namespaces.  While a simple idea, in practice it's
fairly complicated to implement.  Luckily, the required features have
been present in Python for a while, and it's already been implemented
for you as a standard module.

<P>
Code for using a restricted execution environment is in the "<tt>rexec</tt>"
module.  The base class is called <tt>RExec</tt>; in a later section of
this HOWTO, we'll show you how to create your own subclasses of
<tt>RExec</tt> to customize the functions and modules that are available.
Here's the documentation for creating a new <tt>RExec</tt> instance:

<P>
<dl><dt><b><a name="l2h-223"><tt>RExec</tt></a></b> (<var>[<i>hooks</i>], [<i>verbose</i>] </var>)
<dd>
Returns a <tt>RExec</tt> instance.  The <i>verbose</i> parameter is a
Boolean value, defaulting to false.  If true, the <tt>RExec</tt> instance
will execute in verbose mode, which will print a debugging message when
modules are imported, as if the <tt>-v</tt> option was given to the Python
interpreter.

<P>
The <i>hooks</i> parameter can be an instance of the <tt>RHooks</tt>
class, or of some subclass of <tt>RHooks</tt>; a default instance will
be used if the parameter is omitted.  This is only required when
creating particularly exotic restricted environments that import
modules in new ways.  If you need to use this, you'll have to
consult the source code (or Guido) for a complete picture of what's
going on.   
</dl>

<P>
The <tt>RExec</tt> instance has <tt>r_exec()</tt>, <tt>r_eval()</tt>, and
<tt>r_execfile()</tt> functions, which do the same thing as Python's
built-in <tt>exec()</tt>, <tt>eval()</tt>, and <tt>execfile()</tt> functions,
performing them in the restricted environment.  (There are also
<tt>s_exec()</tt>, <tt>s_eval()</tt>, and <tt>s_execfile()</tt> methods which
replace the restricted environment's standard input, output, and error
files with <tt>StringIO</tt> objects that allow you to control the input
and capture any output generated.)

<P>
Here's a sample usage of a restricted environment.  First, the
<tt>RExec</tt> instance has to be created.

<P>
<dl><dd><pre>
r_env = rexec.RExec()
</pre></dl>

<P>
Now, we can execute code and evaluate expressions 
in the environment:

<P>
<dl><dd><pre>
r_env.r_exec('import string')
expr = 'string.upper("This is a test")'
print r_env.r_eval( expr )
</pre></dl>

<P>
The first line executes a statement, importing the <tt>string</tt> module.
Since it's considered a safe module, the operation succeeds.  The second
and third lines create a string containing an expression, and evaluates
the expression in the restricted environment; it prints out "<tt>THIS
IS A TEST</tt>", as you'd expect.

<P>
Unsafe operations trigger an exception.  For example:

<P>
<dl><dd><pre>
r_env.r_exec('import socket')
</pre></dl>

<P>
The previous line will cause an <tt>ImportError</tt> exception to be
raised, with an associated string value that reads "untrusted dynamic
module: socket".  Trying to open a file for writing is also forbidden:

<P>
<dl><dd><pre>
r_env.r_exec('file = open("/tmp/a.out", "w")')
</pre></dl>

<P>
This will raise an <tt>IOError</tt> exception, with an assocated string
value that reads "can't open files for writing in restricted mode".  The
restricted code can catch the exception in a <tt>try...except</tt> block
and continue running; this is useful for writing code which works in
both restricted and unrestricted mode.  Opening files for reading will
work, however.

<P>
Exactly what restrictions does the base <tt>RExec</tt> impose?  It limits
the modules that can be imported to the following safe list:

<P>
<dl><dd><pre>
audioop, array, binascii, cmath, errno, imageop,
marshal, math, md5, operator, parser, regex, 
pcre, rotor, select, strop, struct, time
</pre></dl>

<P>
In general, these are modules that can't affect anything outside of the
executing code; they allow various forms of computation, but don't allow
operations that change the filesystem or use network connections to
other machines.  (The <tt>pcre</tt> module may be unfamiliar; it's an
internal module used by the <tt>re</tt> module; this means that restricted
code can still perform regular expression matches.)

<P>
It also restricts the variables and functions that are available from
the <tt>sys</tt> and <tt>os</tt> modules.  The <tt>sys</tt> module only
contains the following symbols:

<P>
<dl><dd><pre>
ps1, ps2, copyright, version, platform, exit, maxint
</pre></dl>

<P>
The <tt>os</tt> module is reduced to the following functions:

<P>
<dl><dd><pre>
error, fstat, listdir, lstat, readlink,
stat, times, uname, getpid, getppid,
getcwd, getuid, getgid, geteuid, getegid
</pre></dl>

<P>
Note that restricted code has some read-only access to the filesystem
via functions like <tt>os.stat</tt> and <tt>os.readlink</tt>; if you wish to
forbid all access to the filename, these functions must be removed.

<P>
In restricted mode, there are various attributes of function and class
objects that are no longer accessible: the <tt>__dict__</tt> attribute of
class, instance and module objects; the <tt>__self__</tt> attribute of
method objects; and most of the attributes of function objects, namely
<tt>func_code</tt>, <tt>func_defaults</tt>, <tt>func_doc</tt>,
<tt>func_globals</tt>, and <tt>func_name</tt>.

<P>
The <tt>__import__()</tt> and <tt>reload()</tt> functions are replaced by
versions which implement the above restrictions.  Finally, Python's
usual <tt>open()</tt> function is removed and replaced by a restricted
version that only allows opening files for reading.

<P>
To change any of these policies, whether to be stricter or looser, see
the section below on customizing the restricted environment.
